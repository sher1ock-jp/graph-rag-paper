The equivalence is with respect to a simple input-outputfunction, in this case coin counting, which they multiply realize. The systems are also equivalent in terms of their global system dynamics, in the sense that they go through a globally equivalent sequence of internal states. However, because of their different substrates, the three systems specify different cause-effect structures. Therefore, based on the postulates of IIT, they are not phenomenally equivalent. In other words, they are equivalent in what they _do_ extrinsically, but not in what they _are_ intrinsically.\n\nThis dissociation between phenomenal and functional equivalence has important implications. As we have seen, a purely feed-forward system necessarily has \\(\\varphi_{i}=0\\). Therefore, it cannot support a cause-effect structure and cannot be conscious, whereas systems with a recurrent architecture can. On the other hand, the behavior (input-output function) of any (discrete) recurrent system can also be implemented by a system with a feed-forward architecture [54]. This implies that any behavior performed by a conscious system supported by a recurrent architecture can also be performed by an unconscious system, no matter how complex the behavior is. More generally, digital computers implementing programs capable of artificial general intelligence may in principle be able to emulate any function performed by conscious humans and yet, because of the way they are physically organized, they would do so without experiencing anything, or at least anything resembling, in quantity and quality, what each of us experiences [20] (see also (15) in SI Notes).\n\nFigure 8: **Functionally equivalent networks with different \\(\\Phi\\)-structures.** (A) The input\u2013output function realized by three different systems (shown in (C)): a count of eight instances of input \\(I=1\\) leads to output \\(O=1\\). (B) The global state-transition diagram is also the same for the three systems if \\(I=0\\), the systems will remain in their current global state, labeled as \\(0\\)\u2013\\(7\\); if \\(I=1\\), the systems will move one state forward, cycling through their global states, and activate the output if \\(S=0\\). (C) Three systems constituted of the binary units but differing in how the units are connected and interact. As a consequence, the one-to-one mapping between the 3-bit binary states and the global state labels differ. However, all three systems initially transition from \\(000\\) to \\(100\\) to \\(010\\). Analyzed in state \\(100\\), the first system (top) turns out to be a single complex that specifies a \\(\\Phi\\)-structure with six distinctions and many relations, yielding a high value of \\(\\Phi\\). The second system (middle) is also a complex, with the same \\(\\varphi\\), value, but it specifies a \\(\\Phi\\)-structure with fewer distinctions and relations, yielding a lower value of \\(\\Phi\\). Finally, the third system (bottom) is reducible (\\(\\varphi_{i}=0\\)) and splits into three smaller complexes (entities) with minimal \\(\\Phi\\)-structures and low \\(\\Phi\\).\n\nThe examples also show that the overall system dynamics, while often revealing relevant aspects of a system's architecture, typically do not and cannot exhaust the richness of its current cause-effect structure. For example, a system in a fixed point is dynamically \"dead\" (and \"does\" nothing), but it may be phenomenally quite \"alive,\" for example, experiencing \"pure presence\" (see (14) in S1 Notes). Of course, the system's causal powers can be fully unfolded, and revealed dynamically, by extensive manipulations and observations of subsets of system units because they are implicitly captured by the system's causal model and ultimately by its transition probability matrix [29].\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIIT attempts to account for the presence and quality of consciousness in physical terms. It starts from the existence of experience, and proceeds by characterizing its essential properties --those that are immediate and irrefutably true of every conceivable experience (axioms). These are then formulated as essential properties of physical existence (postulates), the necessary and sufficient conditions that a substrate must satisfy to support an experience--to constitute a complex. Note that \"substrate\" is meant in purely operational terms--as a set of units that a conscious observer can observe and manipulate. Likewise, \"physical\" is understood in purely operational terms as cause-effect power--the power to take and make a difference.\n\nThe postulates can be assessed based purely on a substrate's transition probability matrix, as was illustrated by a few idealized causal models. Thus, a substrate of consciousness must be able to take and make a difference upon itself (existence and intrinsicality), it must be able to specify a cause and an effect state that are highly informative and selective (information), and it must do so in a way that is both irreducible (integration) and definite (exclusion). Finally, it must specify its cause and effect in a structured manner (composition), where the causal powers of its subsets over its subsets compose a cause-effect structure of distinctions and relations--a \\(\\Phi\\)-structure. Thus, a complex does not exist as such but only \"unfolded\" as a \\(\\Phi\\)-structure--an _intrinsic entity_ that exists for itself, absolutely, rather than relative to an external observer.\n\nAs shown above, these requirements constrain what substrates can and cannot support consciousness.
