Given an input \\(I=1\\), the system updates its state, cycling through all its 8 global states (labeled 0-7) over 8 updates. For an input of \\(I=0\\), the system remains in its present state. Moreover, all three systems are constituted of three binary units whose joint states map one-to-one onto the systems' global state labels (0-7). However, the mapping is different for different systems (Fig 8C, left). This is because the internal binary update sequence depends on the interactions among the internal units [29, 53], which differ in the three cases, as can easily be determined through manipulations and observations.\n\nFor consistency in the causal powers analysis, in all three cases, the global state \"0\" that activates the output unit if \\(I=1\\) is selected such that it corresponds to the binary state \"all OFF\" (000), which is followed by \\(1\\coloneqq 100\\) and \\(2\\coloneqq 010\\). Also, the \\(\\Phi\\)-structure of each system is unfolded in state \\(1\\coloneqq 100\\) in all three cases.\n\nDespite their functional equivalence and equivalent global dynamics, the systems differ in how they condense into complexes and in the cause-effect structures they specify.\n\nAs shown in Fig 8C, the first system forms a 3-unit complex with a relatively rich \\(\\Phi\\)-structure (\\(\\Phi\\) = 21.01 ibits). While the second system also forms a 3-unit complex with the same \\(\\varphi_{s}=2\\) ibits, it specifies a completely different set of distinctions and has much lower structure integrated information (\\(\\Phi\\) = 3.64 ibits).\n\nFinally, the third system is reducible (\\(\\varphi_{s}=0\\) ibits)--in this case, because there are only feed-forward connections from unit \\(A\\) to units \\(B\\) and \\(C\\)--and it condenses into three complexes with small \\(\\Phi\\)-structures.\n\nThese examples illustrate a simple scenario of functional equivalence of three systems characterized by a different architecture. The equivalence is with respect to a simple input-outputfunction, in this case coin counting, which they multiply realize. The systems are also equivalent in terms of their global system dynamics, in the sense that they go through a globally equivalent sequence of internal states. However, because of their different substrates, the three systems specify different cause-effect structures. Therefore, based on the postulates of IIT, they are not phenomenally equivalent. In other words, they are equivalent in what they _do_ extrinsically, but not in what they _are_ intrinsically.\n\nThis dissociation between phenomenal and functional equivalence has important implications. As we have seen, a purely feed-forward system necessarily has \\(\\varphi_{i}=0\\). Therefore, it cannot support a cause-effect structure and cannot be conscious, whereas systems with a recurrent architecture can. On the other hand, the behavior (input-output function) of any (discrete) recurrent system can also be implemented by a system with a feed-forward architecture [54]. This implies that any behavior performed by a conscious system supported by a recurrent architecture can also be performed by an unconscious system, no matter how complex the behavior is. More generally, digital computers implementing programs capable of artificial general intelligence may in principle be able to emulate any function performed by conscious humans and yet, because of the way they are physically organized, they would do so without experiencing anything, or at least anything resembling, in quantity and quality, what each of us experiences [20] (see also (15) in SI Notes).\n\nFigure 8: **Functionally equivalent networks with different \\(\\Phi\\)-structures.** (A) The input\u2013output function realized by three different systems (shown in (C)): a count of eight instances of input \\(I=1\\) leads to output \\(O=1\\). (B) The global state-transition diagram is also the same for the three systems if \\(I=0\\), the systems will remain in their current global state, labeled as \\(0\\)\u2013\\(7\\); if \\(I=1\\), the systems will move one state forward, cycling through their global states, and activate the output if \\(S=0\\). (C) Three systems constituted of the binary units but differing in how the units are connected and interact. As a consequence, the one-to-one mapping between the 3-bit binary states and the global state labels differ. However, all three systems initially transition from \\(000\\) to \\(100\\) to \\(010\\). Analyzed in state \\(100\\), the first system (top) turns out to be a single complex that specifies a \\(\\Phi\\)-structure with six distinctions and many relations, yielding a high value of \\(\\Phi\\). The second system (middle) is also a complex, with the same \\(\\varphi\\), value, but it specifies a \\(\\Phi\\)-structure with fewer distinctions and relations, yielding a lower value of \\(\\Phi\\). Finally, the third system (bottom) is reducible (\\(\\varphi_{i}=0\\)) and splits into three smaller complexes (entities) with minimal \\(\\Phi\\)-structures and low \\(\\Phi\\).\n\nThe examples also show that the overall system dynamics, while often revealing relevant aspects of a system's architecture, typically do not and cannot exhaust the richness of its current cause-effect structure. For example, a system in a fixed point is dynamically \"dead\" (and \"does\" nothing), but it may be phenomenally quite \"alive,\" for example, experiencing \"pure presence\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>\"System 1\"<|>\"organization\"<|>\"System 1 is one of three functionally equivalent systems with a unique architecture leading to a high \\(\\Phi\\)-structure value, indicating complex cause-effect structures.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"System 2\"<|>\"organization\"<|>\"System 2, functionally equivalent to the others, has a simpler \\(\\Phi\\)-structure than System 1, indicating fewer distinctions and relations.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"System 3\"<|>\"organization\"<|>\"System 3 is functionally equivalent but reducible with minimal \\(\\Phi\\)-structures, indicating it has only feed-forward connections and lacks complex cause-effect structures.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"IIT\"<|>\"organization\"<|>\"Integrated Information Theory (IIT) is referenced as the theoretical framework assessing consciousness and cause-effect structures in systems.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Digital Computers\"<|>\"organization\"<|>\"Digital Computers are mentioned in the context of emulating functions performed by conscious systems without experiencing consciousness.\")##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"System 1\"<|>\"System 2\"<|>\"Both System 1 and System 2 are functionally equivalent but differ in their \\(\\Phi\\)-structure complexity and cause-effect structures.\"<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"System 1\"<|>\"System 3\"<|>\"System 1 and System 3 are functionally equivalent but have vastly different \\(\\Phi\\)-structures, with System 3 being simpler.\"<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"System 2\"<|>\"System 3\"<|>\"System 2 and System 3 are functionally equivalent, differing in their cause-effect structures and complexity of \\(\\Phi\\)-structures.\"<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"Digital Computers\"<|>\"IIT\"<|>\"Digital Computers' ability to emulate conscious functions without experiencing consciousness is discussed within the framework of IIT.\"<|>6)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
