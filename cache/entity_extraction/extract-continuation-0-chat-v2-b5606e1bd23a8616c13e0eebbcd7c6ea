{"result": "I apologize for the oversight. Given the constraints and focusing strictly on the entity types specified (organization, person, geo, event), and based on the text provided, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the initial extraction. The text primarily discusses theoretical concepts and methodologies related to Integrated Information Theory (IIT) without mentioning specific organizations, people, geographical locations, or events in a direct manner that fits the requested entity types. The references made to \"complexes,\" \"universal substrate,\" and \"maximal substrate\" pertain more to theoretical constructs within the framework of IIT rather than to entities that can be classified as organizations, people, geo, or events.\n\nTherefore, based on the given instructions and the text provided, there are no additional entities or relationships that fit the specified types to add. The text discusses theoretical concepts in neuroscience and consciousness studies, which do not directly map to the requested entity types without further context or specific examples that mention organizations, people, geographical locations, or events. \n\nIf there were specific mentions of research institutions, scientists, locations of significant studies, or key historical milestones in the development of IIT within the text, those could be extracted as entities.

Accordingly, the maximal substrate, or complex, is the candidate substrate with the maximum value of system integrated information (\\(\\varphi_{i}\\)), and overlapping substrates with lower \\(\\varphi_{s}\\) are thus excluded from existence.\n\n**Determining maximal substrates recursively.** Within a universal substrate \\(U_{0}\\) in state \\(u_{0}\\), subsets of units that specify maxima of irreducible cause-effect power (complexes) can be identified iteratively: the substrate with maximum \\(\\varphi_{i}^{*}\\) is identified as a complex, the corresponding units are excluded from further consideration, the remaining units are searched for the next maximal substrate. Formally, an iterative search is performed to find a sequence of systems \\(S_{k}^{*}\\subseteq U_{k}\\) with\n\n\\[\\varphi_{i}^{*}(\\mathcal{T}_{e},\\mathcal{T}_{c},u_{k})=\\max_{S_{k}^{*}\\subseteq U _{k}}\\varphi_{i}(\\mathcal{T}_{e},\\mathcal{T}_{c},s), \\tag{24}\\]\n\nsuch that\n\n\\[S_{k}^{*}=\\operatorname*{argmax}_{S_{k}^{*}\\subseteq U_{k}}\\varphi_{i}( \\mathcal{T}_{e},\\mathcal{T}_{c},s), \\tag{25}\\]\n\nand \\(U_{k+1}=U_{k}\\backslash S_{k}^{*}\\) until \\(U_{k+1}=\\emptyset\\) or \\(U_{k+1}=U_{k}\\) (the units in \\(U_{0}U_{k+1}\\) still serve as background conditions, for details see [13]). If the maximal substrate \\(S_{k}^{*}\\) is not unique, and all tied systems overlap, the next best system that is unique is chosen instead (see S1Text).\n\nFor any complex \\(S^{*}\\) in its corresponding state \\(s^{*}\\in\\Omega_{S^{*}}\\), overlapping substrates that specify less integrated information (\\(\\varphi_{i}<\\varphi_{i}(\\mathcal{T}_{e},\\mathcal{T}_{c},s^{*})\\)) are excluded. Consequently, specifying a maximum of integrated information \\(\\varphi_{i}^{*}\\) compared to all overlapping systems\n\n\\[S\\cap\\bar{S}\\neq\\emptyset\\Rightarrow\\varphi_{i}(s)>\\varphi_{i}(\\bar{s}),\\ \\ \\forall S\\neq\\bar{S}\\subseteq U \\tag{26}\\]\n\nis a sufficient requirement for a system \\(S\\subseteq U\\) to be a complex.\n\nAs described in [13], this recursive search for maximal substrates \"condenses\" the universe \\(U_{0}\\) in state \\(u_{0}\\in\\Omega_{U_{0}}\\) into a disjoint (non-overlapping) and exhaustive set of complexes--the first complex, second complex, and so on.\n\nDetermining maximal unit grains.Above, we presented how to determine the borders of a complex within a larger system \\(U\\), assuming a particular grain for the units \\(U_{i}\\in U\\). In principle, however, all possible grains should be considered [33, 34]. In the brain, for example, the grain of units could be brain regions, groups of neurons, individual neurons, sub-cellular structures, molecules, atoms, quarks, or anything finer, down to hypothetical atomic units of cause-effect power [3, 4]. For any unit grain--neurons, for example--the grain of updates could be minutes, seconds, milliseconds, micro-seconds, and so on. However, by the exclusion postulate, the units that constitute a system \\(S\\) must also be definite, in the sense of having a definite grain.\n\nOnce again, the grain is defined by the principle of maximal existence: across the possible micro- and macroscopic levels, the \"winning\" grain is the one that ensures maximally irreducible existence (\\(\\varphi_{i}^{*}\\)) for the entity to which the units belong [33, 34].\n\nTo evaluate integrated information across grains requires a mathematical framework for defining coarser (macro) units from finer (micro) units. Such a framework has been developed in previous work [33, 34, 35], and is updated here to fully align with the postulates.\n\nSupposing that \\(U=u\\) is a universe of micro units in a state, a macro unit \\(J=j\\) is a combination of a set of micro units \\(\\hat{S}\\subseteq U\\), and a mapping \\(g\\) from the state \\(\\hat{S}\\) to the state of \\(J\\),\n\n\\[j=g(\\hat{s}),\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[g:\\Omega_{\\hat{s}}\\rightarrow\\Omega_{J}.\\]\n\nAs constituents of a complex upon which its cause-effect power rests, the units themselves should comply with the postulates of IIT. Otherwise it would be possible to \"make something out of nothing.\" Accordingly, units themselves must also be maximally irreducible, as measured by the integrated information of the units when they are treated as candidate systems (\\(\\varphi_{i}\\)); otherwise, they would not be units but \"disintegrate\" into their constituents. However, in contrast to systems, units only need to be maximally irreducible _within_, because they do not exist as complexes in their own right: a unit \\(J\\) with substrate \\(\\hat{S}\\) qualifies as a candidate unit of\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>\"Integrated Information Theory (IIT)\"<|>\"organization\"<|>\"Integrated Information Theory (IIT) is a theoretical framework for understanding consciousness, emphasizing the importance of integrated information (\\(\\varphi\\)) in determining the presence and level of consciousness in systems.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Complex\"<|>\"geo\"<|>\"In the context of IIT, a 'complex' refers to a subset of units within a universal substrate that specifies a maximum of irreducible cause-effect power, essentially serving as a focal point for consciousness.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Universal Substrate (U)\"<|>\"geo\"<|>\"A universal substrate within IIT refers to the entirety of a system in a given state, from which complexes are identified through the maximization of integrated information (\\(\\varphi\\)).\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Maximal Substrate\"<|>\"geo\"<|>\"A maximal substrate is identified as a complex within the universal substrate that has the highest value of system integrated information (\\(\\varphi_{i}\\)), excluding overlapping substrates with lower \\(\\varphi_{s}\\).\")##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"Complex\"<|>\"Integrated Information Theory (IIT)\"<|>\"Complexes are central to IIT's approach to identifying the presence of consciousness in systems by measuring integrated information.\"<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"Universal Substrate (U)\"<|>\"Complex\"<|>\"Complexes are derived from the universal substrate by identifying subsets of units with maximal irreducible cause-effect power within the framework of IIT.\"<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"Maximal Substrate\"<|>\"Universal Substrate (U)\"<|>\"Maximal substrates are identified within the universal substrate as having the highest value of integrated information, according to IIT principles.\"<|>8)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
