IIT aims to account for the properties of experience in physical (operational) terms. It identifies the essential properties of experience (axioms), infers the necessary and sufficient properties that its substrate must satisfy (postulates), and expresses them in mathematical terms. In principle, the postulates can be applied to any system of units in a state to determine whether it is conscious, to what degree, and in what way. IIT offers a parsimonious explanation of empirical evidence, makes testable predictions concerning both the presence and the quality of experience, and permits inferences and extrapolations. IIT 4.0 incorporates several developments of the past ten years, including a more accurate formulation of the axioms as postulates and mathematical expressions, the introduction of a unique measure of intrinsic information that is consistent with the postulates, and an explicit assessment of causal relations. By fully unfolding a system's irreducible cause-effect power, the distinctions and relations specified by a substrate can account for the quality of experience.\n\n## Author summary\n\nAs a theory of consciousness, IIT aims to answer two questions: 1) Why is experience present vs. absent? and 2) Why do specific experiences feel the way they do? The theory's starting point is the existence of experience. IIT then aims to account for phenomenal existence and its essential properties in physical terms. It concludes that a substrate--a set of interacting units--can support consciousness if it can take and make a difference for itself (intrinsicality), select a specific cause and effect as an irreducible whole with a Wisconsin-Madison, by the Tiny Blue Dot Foundation (IWT 133AGAG345I; G.T.), and by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (MSERC, GRIPN-2019-05418; W.M.).

The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.\n\n### Competing interests:\n\nI have read the journal's policy and the authors of this manuscript have the following competing interests: G.T. holds an executive position and has a financial interest in Intrinsic Powers, Inc., a company whose purpose is to develop a device that can be used in the clinic to assess the presence and absence of consciousness in patients. This does not pose any conflict of interest with regard to the work undertaken for this publication.\n\nIIT aims to account for phenomenal properties--the properties of experience--in physical terms. IIT's starting point is experience itself rather than its behavioral, functional, or neural correlates [1]. Furthermore, in IIT \"physical\" is meant in a strictly operational sense--in terms of what can be observed and manipulated.\n\nThe starting point of IIT is the existence of an experience, which is immediate and irrefutable [3]. From this \"zeroth\" axiom, IIT sets out to identify the essential properties of consciousness--those that are immediate and irrefutably true of every conceivable experience. These are IIT's five axioms of phenomenal existence: every experience is for the experiencer (intrinsically), specific (information), unitary (integration), definite (exclusion), and structured (composition).\n\nUnlike phenomenal existence, which is immediate and irrefutable (an axiom), physical existence is an explanatory construct (a postulate), and it is assessed operationally (from within consciousness): in physical terms, to be is to have cause-effect power. In other words, something can be said to exist physically if it can \"take and make a difference\"--bear a cause and produce an effect--as judged by a conscious observer/manipulator.\n\nThe next\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>\"Integrated Information Theory (IIT) 4.0\"<|>\"event\"<|>\"IIT 4.0 is the latest iteration of Integrated Information Theory, aiming to account for the properties of experience in physical terms, identifying axioms of experience, and expressing them mathematically.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Larissa Albantakis\"<|>\"person\"<|>\"Larissa Albantakis is listed as an author of the paper on Integrated Information Theory (IIT) 4.0.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Leonardo Barbosa\"<|>\"person\"<|>\"Leonardo Barbosa is listed as an author of the paper on Integrated Information Theory (IIT) 4.0.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Graham Findlay\"<|>\"person\"<|>\"Graham Findlay is listed as an author of the paper on Integrated Information Theory (IIT) 4.0.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Matteo Grasso\"<|>\"person\"<|>\"Matteo Grasso is listed as an author of the paper on Integrated Information Theory (IIT) 4.0.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Andrew M.
