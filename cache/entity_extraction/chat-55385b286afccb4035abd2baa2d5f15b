If \\(\\operatorname{ii}_{\\epsilon}(\\mathcal{T}_{\\epsilon},s)=0\\), the system \\(S\\) in state \\(s\\) has no causal power. This is the case if and only if \\(p_{\\epsilon}(\\bar{s}\\mid s)=p_{\\epsilon}(\\bar{s})\\) for every \\(\\bar{s}\\)[14] (and likewise, it can be shown that \\(\\operatorname{ii}_{\\epsilon}(\\mathcal{T}_{\\epsilon},s)=0\\) if and only if \\(p_{\\epsilon}(s\\mid\\bar{s})=p_{\\epsilon}(s)\\) for every \\(\\bar{s}\\).) It is worthwhile to mention that when \\(\\operatorname{ii}_{\\epsilon}(\\mathcal{T}_{\\epsilon},s)\\neq 0\\), the system state \\(s\\) always increases the probability of the intrinsic effect state compared to chance. Similarly, when \\(\\operatorname{ii}_{\\epsilon}(\\mathcal{T}_{\\epsilon},s)\\neq 0\\) the intrinsic cause state increases the probability of the system state, satisfying (11). Note also that a system's intrinsic cause-effect state does not necessarily correspond to the actual cause and effect states (what actually happened before / will happen after) in the dynamical evolution of the system, which typically also depends on extrinsic influences. (For an account of actual causation according to the causal principles of IIT, see [10].).\n\n**Intrinsic difference.** Because consciousness is the way it is, the formulation of its properties in physical, operational terms should be unique and based on quantities that uniquely satisfy the postulates [12, 32]. Intrinsic information is formulated as a product of selectivity and informativeness based on the notion of intrinsic difference (ID) [14]. This is a measure of the difference between two probability distributions which uniquely satisfies three properties (causality, intrinsicality, and specificity) that align with the postulates of IIT (but also have independent justification):causality (Existence): the measure is zero if and only if the system does not make a difference\n\n**intrinsicality (Intrinsicality)**: the measure increases if the system is expanded without noise (expansion) and decreases if the system is expanded without signal (dilution)\n**specificity (Information)**: the measure reflects the cause-effect power of a specific state over a specific cause and effect state.\n\nThe properties uniquely satisfied by the ID are described in a general mathematical context in [14], as well as some additional discussion in S2 Text.\n\nNote that, on the effect side, ii\\({}_{e}\\) is formally equivalent to the ID between the constrained effect repertoire \\(p_{e}(\\bar{s}\\mid s)\\) and the unconstrained effect repertoire \\(p_{e}(\\bar{s})\\). On the cause side, the application of Bayes rule to compute \\(p_{e}^{-}(\\bar{s}\\mid s)\\) as the selectivity term means that ii\\({}_{e}\\) is not strictly equivalent to the ID between two probability distributions. However, analogously to the effect formulation, it is defined as the product of selectivity and informativeness of causes.\n\n### Integration: Determining the irreducibility of a candidate system\n\nHaving identified the maximal cause-effect state \\(s^{\\prime}=\\{s^{\\prime}_{e},s^{\\prime}_{e}\\}\\) of a candidate system \\(S\\) in its current state \\(s\\), the next step is to evaluate whether the system specifies the cause-effect state of its units in a way that is _irreducible_, as required by the integration postulate: a candidate system can only be a substrate of consciousness if it is _one_ system--that is, if it cannot be subdivided into subsets of units that exist separately from one another.\n\n**Directional system partitions.** To that end, we define a set of _directional_ system partitions \\(\\Theta(S)\\) that divide \\(S\\) into \\(k\\geq 2\\) parts \\(\\{S^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^{k}\\), such that\n\n\\[S^{(i)}\\neq\\o,\\ \\ S^{(i)}\\cap S^{(j)}=\\o,\\ \\ \\text{and}\\ \\bigcup_{i=1}^{k}S^{(i)}=S. \\tag{14}\\]\n\nIn words, each part \\(S^{(i)}\\) must contain at least one unit, there must be no overlap between any two parts \\(S^{(i)}\\) and \\(S^{(j)}\\), and every unit of the system must appear in exactly one part. For each part \\(S^{(i)}\\), the partition removes the causal connections of that part with the rest of the system in a directional manner: either the part's inputs, outputs\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
