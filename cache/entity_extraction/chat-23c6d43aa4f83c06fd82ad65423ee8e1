Note that informativeness is expressed in terms of 'forward' probabilities (probability of a subsequent state given the current state) for both \\(\\mathrm{ii}_{e}\\left(\\bar{s}\\right)\\) and \\(\\mathrm{ii}_{c}\\left(\\bar{\\mathcal{T}}\\right)\\). However, \\(\\mathrm{ii}_{e}\\left(\\bar{s}\\right)\\) evaluates the increase in probability of the effect state due to the current state based on \\(\\mathcal{T}_{e}\\), while \\(\\mathrm{ii}_{c}\\left(\\bar{\\mathcal{T}}\\right)\\) evaluates the increase in probability of the current state due to the cause state based on \\(\\mathcal{T}_{e}\\).\n\nIn line with the existence postulate, a system \\(S\\) in state \\(s\\) has cause-effect power (it takes and makes a difference) if it raises the probability of a possible effect state compared to chance, which is to say compared to its unconstrained probability,\n\n\\[\\log\\left(\\frac{p_{c}(\\bar{s}\\mid s)}{p_{c}(\\bar{s})}\\right)>0, \\tag{10}\\]\n\nand if the probability of the current state is raised above chance by a possible cause state,\n\n\\[\\log\\left(\\frac{p_{c}(s\\mid\\bar{s})}{p_{c}(\\bar{s})}\\right)>0. \\tag{11}\\]\n\nInformativeness is additive over the number of units: if a system specifies a cause or effect state with probability \\(p=1\\), its causal power increases additively with the number of units whose states it fully specifies (_expansion_), given that the chance probability of all states decreases exponentially.\n\nSelectivity (over states).From the intrinsic perspective of a system, cause-effect power over a specific cause or effect state depends not only on the deviation from chance it produces, but also on how its probability is concentrated on that state, rather than being diluted over other states. This is measured by the _selectivity_ term in front of the logarithmic term in (5) and (7), corresponding to the conditional probability \\(p_{c}^{-}(\\bar{s}\\mid s)\\) or \\(p_{c}(\\bar{s}\\mid s)\\) of that specific cause or effect state. (Note that here, on the cause side, we use the 'backward' probability (probability of a prior state given the current state) obtained through Bayes' rule, while we use the 'forward' probability of the effect state \\(\\bar{s}\\) given \\(s\\) on the effect side.) Selectivity means that if \\(p<1\\), the system's causal power becomes subadditive (_dilution_) (see [14] for details).
