The examples also demonstrate the role played by the various requirements that must be satisfied by a substrate of consciousness: existence (causal power), intrinsicality, specificity, maximal irreducibility (integration and exclusion), and composition (structure).\n\n### Consciousness and activity: Active, inactive, and inactivated units\n\nA substrate exerts cause-effect power in its current state. For the same substrate, changing the state of even one unit may have major consequences on the distinctions and relations that compose its \\(\\Phi\\)-structure: many may be lost, or gained, and many may change their value of irreducibility (\\(\\varphi_{d}\\) and \\(\\varphi_{r}\\)).\n\nFig.7 shows a network of five binary units that interact through excitatory and inhibitory connections (weights indicated in the figure). The system is initially in state \\(s=ABcdE\\) (Fig 7A) and is a maximal substrate with \\(\\varphi_{s}=1.1\\) bits and a \\(\\Phi\\)-structure composed of 23 distinctions and their 13740 relations.\n\nIf we change the state of unit \\(E\\) from ON to OFF (in neural terms, the unit becomes inactive), the distinctions that the unit contributes to when ON, as well as the associated relations, may change (Fig 7B). In the case illustrated by the Figure, what changes are the purviews and irreducibility of several distinctions and associated relations, the number of distinctions stays the same, \\(\\varphi_{s}\\) changes only slightly, but the number of relations is lower, leading to a lower \\(\\Phi\\) value. In other words, what a single unit contributes to intrinsic existence is not some small \"bit\" of information. Instead, a unit contributes an entire sub-structure, composed of a very large number of distinctions and relations. The set of distinctions to which a subset of units contributes as a mechanism, either alone or in combination with other units, together with their associated relations, forms a compound \\(\\Phi\\)-fold. With respect to the neural substrate of consciousness in the brain, this means that even a change in the state of a single unit is typically associated with a change in an entire \\(\\Phi\\)-fold within the overall \\(\\Phi\\)-structure, with a corresponding change in the structure of the experience. (Note, however, that in larger systems such changes will typically be less extreme, see also [11].).\n\nIn Fig 7C, we see what happens if unit \\(E\\), instead of just turning inactive (OFF) is _inactivated_ (abolishing its cause-effect power because it no longer has any counterfactual states and thus cannot be intervened upon). In this case, all the distinctions and relations to which that unit contributes as a mechanism would cease to exist (its compound \\(\\Phi\\)-fold collapses). Moreover, all the distinctions and relations to whose purviews that unit contributes--its purview \\(\\Phi\\)-fold --would also collapse or change. In fact, the complex shrinks because it cannot include that unit. With respect to the neural substrate of consciousness, this means that while an inactive unit contributes to a different experience, an inactivated unit ceases to contribute to experience altogether. The fundamental difference between inactive and inactivated units leads to the \n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:35]\n\nfollowing corollary of IIT: unlike a fully inactivated substrate which, as would be suspected, cannot support any experience, an inactive substrate can. If a maximal substrate in an inactive state is in working order and specifies a large \\(\\Phi\\)-structure, it will support a highly structured experience, such as the experience of empty space [11] or the feeling of \"pure presence\" (see (14) in S1Notes).\n\n### Consciousness and functional equivalence: Being is not doing\n\nBy the intrinsicality postulate, the \\(\\Phi\\)-structure of a complex depends on the causal interactions between system subsets, not on the system's interaction with its environment (except for the role of the environment in triggering specific system states). In general, different physical systems with different internal causal structure may perform the same input-output functions.\n\nFig 8 shows three simple deterministic systems with binary units (here the \"OFF\" state is 0, and \"ON\" is 1) that perform the same input-output function, treating the internal dynamics of the system as a black box. The function could be thought of, for example, as an electronic toll-booth \"counting 8 valid coins\" (8 times input \\(I=1\\)) before opening the gate [53]. Each system receives one binary input (\\(I\\)) and has one binary output (\\(O\\)). The output unit switches \"ON\" on a count of eight positive inputs \\(I=1\\) (when the global state with label '0' is reached in the cycle), upon which the system resets (Fig 8A).\n\nIn addition to being functionally equivalent in their outward behavior, the three systems share the same internal global dynamics, as their internal states update according to the same global state-transition diagram (Fig 8B). Given an input \\(I=1\\), the system updates its state, cycling through all its 8 global states (labeled 0-7) over 8 updates. For an input of \\(I=0\\), the system remains in its present state. Moreover, all three systems are constituted of three binary units whose joint states map\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
