I mean\nto give him the same chance every year, whether he likes it or not, for\nI pity him. He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can't help\nthinking better of it--I defy him--if he finds me going there, in good\ntemper, year after year, and saying, \"Uncle Scrooge, how are you?\" If it\nonly put him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, _that's_\nsomething; and I think I shook him yesterday.'\n\nIt was their turn to laugh now, at the notion of his shaking Scrooge.\nBut being thoroughly good-natured, and not much caring what they laughed\nat, so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged them in their\nmerriment, and passed the bottle, joyously.\n\nAfter tea they had some music. For they were a musical family, and knew\nwhat they were about when they sung a Glee or Catch, I can assure you:\nespecially Topper, who could growl away in the bass like a good one, and\nnever swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face over\nit. Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp; and played, among other\ntunes, a simple little air (a mere nothing: you might learn to whistle\nit in two minutes) which had been familiar to the child who fetched\nScrooge from the boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost\nof Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the things\nthat Ghost had shown him came upon his mind; he softened more and more;\nand thought that if he could have listened to it often, years ago, he\nmight have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with\nhis own hands, without resorting to the sexton's spade that buried Jacob\nMarley.\n\n[Illustration: _The way he went after that plump sister in the lace\ntucker!_]\n\nBut they didn't devote the whole evening to music. After a while they\nplayed at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and never\nbetter than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself.\nStop! There was first a game at blind man's-buff. Of course there was.\nAnd I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes\nin his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done thing between him and\nScrooge's nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The\nway he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on\nthe credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons, tumbling\nover the chairs, bumping up against the piano, smothering himself\namongst the curtains, wherever she went, there went he! He always knew\nwhere the plump sister was. He wouldn't catch anybody else. If you had\nfallen up against him (as some of them did) on purpose, he would have\nmade a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would have been an\naffront to your understanding, and would instantly have sidled off in\nthe direction of the plump sister. She often cried out that it wasn't\nfair; and it really was not. But when, at last, he caught her; when, in\nspite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him,\nhe got her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his conduct\nwas the most execrable. For his pretending not to know her; his\npretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and further to\nassure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her\nfinger, and a certain chain about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No\ndoubt she told him her opinion of it when, another blind man being in\noffice, they were so very confidential together behind the curtains.\n\nScrooge's niece was not one of the blind man's-buff party, but was made\ncomfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug corner where\nthe Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her. But she joined in the\nforfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the\nalphabet. Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very\ngreat, and, to the secret joy of Scrooge's nephew, beat her sisters\nhollow; though they were sharp girls too, as Topper could have told you.\nThere might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all\nplayed, and so did Scrooge; for wholly forgetting, in the interest he\nhad in what was going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he\nsometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often guessed\nright, too; for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>\"Scrooge's Nephew\"<|>\"person\"<|>\"Scrooge's nephew is depicted as a jovial and optimistic character, encouraging merriment and expressing pity for Scrooge's isolation and bitterness, especially during Christmas.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Plump Sister\"<|>\"person\"<|>\"The plump sister is a character involved in the Christmas celebrations, notably in the game of blind man's-buff, and is pursued by Topper.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Scrooge\"<|>\"person\"<|>\"Scrooge is characterized by his dislike for Christmas and merriment, his isolation, and his transformation through the experiences shown by the Ghost of Christmas Past.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Topper\"<|>\"person\"<|>\"Topper is a guest at Scrooge's nephew's Christmas party, known for his musical talent and his playful pursuit of the plump sister during the game of blind man's-buff.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Scrooge's Niece\"<|>\"person\"<|>\"Scrooge's niece is talented in playing the harp, participates in Christmas games, and is admired for her skill in the game of How, When, and Where.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Ghost of Christmas Past\"<|>\"person\"<|>\"The Ghost of Christmas Past is a spectral figure that shows Scrooge scenes from his past to reflect on his life and choices.\")##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"Scrooge's Nephew\"<|>\"Scrooge\"<|>\"Scrooge's nephew is determined to invite Scrooge to Christmas every year despite Scrooge's reluctance, showing a familial connection and concern for Scrooge's well-being.\"<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"Topper\"<|>\"Plump Sister\"<|>\"Topper shows a particular interest in the plump sister during the games at the Christmas party, indicating a playful or romantic connection.\"<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"Scrooge's Niece\"<|>\"Scrooge\"<|>\"Scrooge's niece, by participating in the Christmas celebrations and showing talent and joy, contrasts with Scrooge's initial disdain for the holiday and familial gatherings.\"<|>6)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"Scrooge\"<|>\"Ghost of Christmas Past\"<|>\"The Ghost of Christmas Past plays a crucial role in Scrooge's transformation by revealing to him the consequences of his actions and the joy he missed out on.\"<|>9)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
