More generally, further validation of IIT will depend on a systematic back-and-forth between phenomenology, theoretical inferences, and neuroscientific evidence [1].\n\nIn addition to empirical work aimed at validating the theory, much remains to be done at the theoretical level. According to IIT, the meaning of an experience is its feeling--whether those of spatial extendedness, of temporal flow, or of objects, to name but a few (\"the meaning is the feeling\"). This means that every meaning is identical to a sub-structure within a current \\(\\Phi\\)-structure--a content of experience--whether it is triggered by extrinsic inputs or it occurs spontaneously during a dream. Therefore, all meaning is ultimately intrinsic. Ongoing work aims at providing a self-consistent explanation of how intrinsic meanings can capture relevant features of causal processes in the environment (see (17) in S1 Notes). It will also be important to explain how intersubjectively validated knowledge can be obtained despite the intrinsic and partially idiosyncratic nature of meaning.\n\nTo the extent that the theory is validated through empirical evidence obtained from the human brain, IIT can then offer a plausible inferential basis for addressing several questions that depend on an explicit theory of consciousness. As indicated in the section on phenomenal and functional equivalence, and argued in ongoing work [20], one consequence of IIT is that typical computer architectures are not suitable for supporting consciousness, no matter whether their behavior may resemble ours. By the same token, it can be inferred from IIT that animal species that may look and behave quite differently from us may be highly conscious, as long as their brains have a compatible architecture. Other inferences concern our own experience and whether it plays a causal role, or is simply \"along for the ride\" while our brain performs its functions. As recently argued, IIT implies that we have true free will--that we have true alternatives, make true decisions, and truly cause. Because only what truly exists (intrinsically, for itself) can truly cause, we, rather than our neurons, cause our willed actions and are responsible for their consequences [18].\n\nFinally, an ontology that is grounded in experience as intrinsic existence--an intrinsic ontology--must not only provide an account of subjective existence in objective, operational terms, but also offer a path toward a unified view of nature--of all that exists and happens. One step in this direction is the application of the same postulates that define causal powers (existence) to the evaluation of actual causes and effects (\"what caused what\" [10]). Another is to unify classical accounts of information (as communication and storage of signals) with IIT's notion of information as derived from the properties of experience--that is, information as causal, intrinsic, specific, maximally irreducible, and structured (meaningful) [8] (see also (18) in S1 Notes). Yet another is the study of the evolution of a substrate's causal powers as conditional probabilities that update themselves [61].\n\nEven so, there are many ways in which IIT may turn out to be inadequate or wrong. Are some of its assumptions, including those of a discrete, finite set of \"atomic\" units of cause-effect power, incompatible with current physics [32, 62] (but see [63, 64, 65, 66])? Are its axiomatic basis and the formulation of axioms as postulates sound and unique? And, most critically, can IIT survive the results of empirical investigations assessing the relationship between the quantity and quality of consciousness and its substrate in the brain?\n\n## Supporting information\n\n**S1 Text.
