This set is called a _maximal substrate_, also known as a _complex_[8, 13].\n**Composition**: Its cause-effect power must be _structured_: subsets of its units must specify cause-effect states over subsets of units (_distinctions_) that can overlap with one another (_relations_), yielding a _cause-effect structure_ or _\\(\\Phi\\)-structure_ (\"Phi-structure\") that is _the way it is_.\n\nDistinctions and relations, in turn, must also satisfy the postulates of physical existence: they must have cause-effect power, within the substrate of consciousness, in a specific, unitary, and definite way (they do not have components, being components themselves). They thus have an associated \\(\\varphi\\) value. The \\(\\Phi\\)-structure unfolded from a complex corresponds to the quality of consciousness. The sum total of the \\(\\varphi\\) values of the distinctions and relations that compose the \\(\\Phi\\)-structure measures its _structure integrated information_\\(\\Phi\\) (\"big phi,\" \"structure Phi\") and corresponds to the quantity of consciousness.\n\nAccording to IIT, the physical properties characterized by the postulates are necessary and sufficient for an entity to be conscious. They are necessary because they are needed to account for the properties of experience that are essential, in the sense that it is inconceivable for an experience to lack any one of them. They are also sufficient because no additional property of experience is essential, in the sense that it is conceivable for an experience to lack that property. Thus, no additional physical property is a necessary requirement for being a substrate of consciousness.\n\nThe postulates of IIT have been and are being applied to account for the location of the substrate of consciousness in the brain [4] and for its loss and recovery in physiological and pathological conditions [22, 23].\n\n### The explanatory identity between experiences and \\(\\Phi\\)-structures\n\nHaving determined the necessary and sufficient conditions for a substrate to support consciousness, IIT proposes an explanatory identity: every property of an experience is accountedfor in full by the physical properties of the \\(\\Phi\\)-structure unfolded from a maximal substrate (a complex) in its current state, with no further or \"ad hoc\" ingredients. That is, there must be a one-to-one correspondence between the way the experience feels and the way distinctions and relations are structured. Importantly, the identity is not meant as a correspondence between the properties of two separate things. Instead, the identity should be understood in an explanatory sense: the intrinsic (subjective) feeling of the experience can be explained extrinsically (objectively, _i.e._, operationally or physically) in terms of cause-effect power (see (4) in S1 Notes).\n\nThe explanatory identity has been applied to account for how space feels (spatial extendedness) and which neural substrates may account for it [11]. Ongoing work is applying the identity to provide a basic account of the feeling of temporal flow [24] and that of objects [25].\n\n## Box 1. Methodological guidelines of IIT\n\n### Inference to a good explanation\n\nWe should generally assume that an explanation is good if it can account for a broad set of facts (_scope_), does so in a unified manner (_synthesis_), can explain facts precisely (_specificity_), is internally coherent (_self-consistency_), is coherent with our overall understanding of things (_system consistency_), is simpler than alternatives (_simplicity_), and can make testable predictions (_scientific validation_). For example, IIT 4.0 aims at expressing the postulates of intrinsicality, information, integration, and exclusion in a self-consistent manner when applied to systems, causal distinctions, and relations (see formulas).\n\n### Realism\n\nWe should assume that something exists (and persists) independently of our own experience. This is a much better hypothesis than solipsism, which explains nothing and predicts nothing. Although IIT starts from our own phenomenology, it aims to account for the many regularities of experience in a way that is fully consistent with realism.\n\n### Operational physicalism\n\nTo assess what exists independently of our own experience, we should employ an operational criterion: we should systematically observe and manipulate a substrate's units and determine that they can indeed take and make a difference in a way that is reliable.\n\nDoing so demonstrates a substrate's cause-effect power--the signature of physical existence. Ideally, cause-effect power is fully captured by a substrate's transition probability matrix (TPM) (1). This assumption is embedded in IIT's zeroth postulate.\n\n### Operational reductionism (\"atomism\")\n\nIdeally, we should account for what exists physically in terms of the smallest units we can observe and manipulate, as captured by unit TPMs. Doing so would leave nothing unaccounted for. IIT assumes that, in principle, it should be possible to account for everything purely in terms of cause-effect power--cause-effect power \"all the way down\" to conditional probabilities between atomic units (see (5) in S1 Notes). Eventually, this would leave neither room nor need to assume intrinsic properties or laws.\n\n### Intrinsic perspective\n\nWhen accounting for experience itself in physical terms, existence should be evaluated from the intrinsic perspective of an entity--what exists for\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>\"Integrated Information Theory (IIT)\"<|>\"organization\"<|>\"IIT is a theoretical framework aimed at understanding consciousness through principles such as intrinsicality, information, integration, exclusion, and operational physicalism.
