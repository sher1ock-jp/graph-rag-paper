Thus, no additional physical property is a necessary requirement for being a substrate of consciousness.\n\nThe postulates of IIT have been and are being applied to account for the location of the substrate of consciousness in the brain [4] and for its loss and recovery in physiological and pathological conditions [22, 23].\n\n### The explanatory identity between experiences and \\(\\Phi\\)-structures\n\nHaving determined the necessary and sufficient conditions for a substrate to support consciousness, IIT proposes an explanatory identity: every property of an experience is accountedfor in full by the physical properties of the \\(\\Phi\\)-structure unfolded from a maximal substrate (a complex) in its current state, with no further or \"ad hoc\" ingredients. That is, there must be a one-to-one correspondence between the way the experience feels and the way distinctions and relations are structured. Importantly, the identity is not meant as a correspondence between the properties of two separate things. Instead, the identity should be understood in an explanatory sense: the intrinsic (subjective) feeling of the experience can be explained extrinsically (objectively, _i.e._, operationally or physically) in terms of cause-effect power (see (4) in S1 Notes).\n\nThe explanatory identity has been applied to account for how space feels (spatial extendedness) and which neural substrates may account for it [11]. Ongoing work is applying the identity to provide a basic account of the feeling of temporal flow [24] and that of objects [25].\n\n## Box 1. Methodological guidelines of IIT\n\n### Inference to a good explanation\n\nWe should generally assume that an explanation is good if it can account for a broad set of facts (_scope_), does so in a unified manner (_synthesis_), can explain facts precisely (_specificity_), is internally coherent (_self-consistency_), is coherent with our overall understanding of things (_system consistency_), is simpler than alternatives (_simplicity_), and can make testable predictions (_scientific validation_). For example, IIT 4.0 aims at expressing the postulates of intrinsicality, information, integration, and exclusion in a self-consistent manner when applied to systems, causal distinctions, and relations (see formulas).\n\n### Realism\n\nWe should assume that something exists (and persists) independently of our own experience. This is a much better hypothesis than solipsism, which explains nothing and predicts nothing. Although IIT starts from our own phenomenology, it aims to account for the many regularities of experience in a way that is fully consistent with realism.\n\n### Operational physicalism\n\nTo assess what exists independently of our own experience, we should employ an operational criterion: we should systematically observe and manipulate a substrate's units and determine that they can indeed take and make a difference in a way that is reliable.\n\nDoing so demonstrates a substrate's cause-effect power--the signature of physical existence. Ideally, cause-effect power is fully captured by a substrate's transition probability matrix (TPM) (1). This assumption is embedded in IIT's zeroth postulate.\n\n### Operational reductionism (\"atomism\")\n\nIdeally, we should account for what exists physically in terms of the smallest units we can observe and manipulate, as captured by unit TPMs. Doing so would leave nothing unaccounted for. IIT assumes that, in principle, it should be possible to account for everything purely in terms of cause-effect power--cause-effect power \"all the way down\" to conditional probabilities between atomic units (see (5) in S1 Notes). Eventually, this would leave neither room nor need to assume intrinsic properties or laws.\n\n### Intrinsic perspective\n\nWhen accounting for experience itself in physical terms, existence should be evaluated from the intrinsic perspective of an entity--what exists for the entity itself--not from the perspective of an external observer. This assumption is embedded in IIT's postulate of intrinsicality and has several consequences. One is that, from the intrinsic perspective, the quality and quantity of existence must be observer-independent and cannot be arbitrary. For instance, information in IIT must be relative to the specific state the entity is in, rather than an average of states as assessed by an external observer. Similarly, it should be evaluated based on the uniform distribution of possible states, as captured by the entity's TPM (1), rather than on an observed probability distribution. By the same token, units outside the entity should be treated as background conditions that do not contribute directly to what the system is. The intrinsic perspective also imposes a tension between expansion and dilution (see below and [12, 14]): from the intrinsic perspective of a system (or a mechanism within the system), having more units may increase its informativeness (cause-effect power measured as deviation from chance), while at the same time diluting its selectivity (ability to concentrate cause-effect power over a specific state).\n\n### Overview of IIT's framework\n\nIIT 4.0 aims at providing a formal framework to characterize the cause-effect structure of a substrate in a given state by expressing IIT's postulates in mathematical terms. In line with operational physicalism (Box1), we characterize a substrate by the transition probability function of its constituting units.\n\nOn this basis, the IIT formalism first identifies sets of units that fulfill all required properties of a substrate of consciousness according to the postulates of physical existence. First, for a candidate system, we determine a maximal cause-effect state based on the intrinsic information (ii) that the system in its current state specifies over its possible cause states and effect states. We then determine the maximal substrate based on the integrated information (\\(\\varphi_{s}\\), \"system phi\") of the maximal cause-effect state. To qualify as a substrate of consciousness, a candidate system must specify a maximum\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>\"IIT\"<|>\"organization\"<|>\"IIT, or Integrated Information Theory, proposes a framework for understanding consciousness through intrinsic information, integration, and exclusion, aiming to account for the substrate of consciousness in the brain and its variations in physiological and pathological conditions.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Consciousness\"<|>\"event\"<|>\"Consciousness is described as a state or experience that can be accounted for by the physical properties of a \\(\\Phi\\)-structure according to IIT.
