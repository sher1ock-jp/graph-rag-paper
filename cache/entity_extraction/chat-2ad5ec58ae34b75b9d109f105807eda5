Thus, a complex does not exist as such but only \"unfolded\" as a \\(\\Phi\\)-structure--an _intrinsic entity_ that exists for itself, absolutely, rather than relative to an external observer.\n\nAs shown above, these requirements constrain what substrates can and cannot support consciousness. Substrates that lack in specificity, due to indeterminism and/or degeneracy, cannot grow to be large complexes. Substrates that are weakly integrated, due to architectural or functional fault lines in their interactions, are less integrated than some of their subsets. Because they are not maximally irreducible, they do not qualify as complexes. This is the case even though they may \"hang together\" well enough from an extrinsic perspective (having a respectable value of \\(\\varphi_{\\text{s}}\\)). Furthermore, even substrates that are maximally integrated may support \\(\\Phi\\)-structures that are extremely sparse, as in the case of directed cycles. Based on the postulates of IIT, a universal substrate ultimately \"condenses\" into a set of disjoint (non-overlapping) complexes, each constituted of a set of macro or micro units.\n\nThe physical account of consciousness provided by IIT should be understood as an explanatory identity: every property of an experience should ultimately be accounted for by a property of the cause-effect structure specified by a substrate that satisfies its postulates, with no additional ingredients. The identity is not between two different substances or realms--the phenomenal and the physical--but between intrinsic (subjective) existence and extrinsic (objective) existence. Intrinsic existence is immediate and irrefutable, while extrinsic existence is defined operationally as cause-effect power discovered through observation and manipulation. The primacy of intrinsic existence (of experience) in IIT contrasts with standard attempts at accounting for consciousness as something \"generated by\" or \"emerging from\" a substrate constituted of matter and energy and following physical laws.\n\nThe physical correspondent of an experience is not the substrate as such but the \\(\\Phi\\)-structure specified by the substrate in its current state. Therefore, minor changes in the substrate state can correspond to major changes in the specified \\(\\Phi\\)-structure. For example, if the state of a single unit changes, an entire \\(\\Phi\\)-fold within the \\(\\Phi\\)-structure will change, and if a single inactive unit is inactivated, its associated \\(\\Phi\\)-fold will collapse, even though the current state of the substrate appears the same (Fig.7).\n\nEach experience corresponds to a \\(\\Phi\\)-structure, not a set of functions, processes, or computations. Said otherwise, consciousness is about being, not doing [1, 29, 55]. This means that systems with different architectures may be functionally equivalent--both in terms of global input-output functions and global intrinsic dynamics--but they will not be phenomenally equivalent. For example, a feed-forward system can be functionally equivalent to a recurrent system that constitutes a complex, but feed-forward systems cannot constitute complexes because they do not satisfy maximal irreducibility. Accordingly, artificial systems powered by super-intelligent computer programs, but implemented by feed-forward hardware or encompassing critical bottlenecks, would experience nothing (or nearly nothing) because they have the wrong kind of physical architecture, even though they may be behaviorally indistinguishable from human beings [20].\n\nEven though the entire framework of IIT is based on just a few axioms and postulates, it is not possible in practice to exhaustively apply the postulates to unfold the cause-effect power of realistic systems [32, 56]. It is not feasible to perform all possible observations and manipulations to fully characterize a universal TPM, or to perform all calculations on the TPM that would be necessary to condense it exhaustively into complexes and unfold their cause-effect power in full. The number of possible systems, of system partitions, of candidate distinctions --each with their partitions and relations--is the result of multiple, nested combinatorial explosions. Moreover, these observations, manipulations, and calculations would need to be repeated at many different grains, with many rounds of maximizations. For these reasons, a full analysis of complexes and their cause-effect structure can only be performed on idealized systems of a few units [37].\n\nOn the other hand, we can simplify the computation considerably by using various assumptions and approximations, as with the \"cut one\" approximation described in [37]. Also, while the number of relations vastly exceeds the number of units and of distinctions (its upper bound for a system of \\(n\\) units is \\(2^{(\\mathcal{P}^{-1})}-1\\)), it can be determined analytically, and so can \\(\\Sigma\\varphi\\), for a given set of distinctions S3Text. Developing tight approximations, as well as bounded estimates of a system's integrated information (\\(\\varphi_{*}\\) and \\(\\varphi\\)), is one of the main areas of ongoing research related to IIT [50].\n\nDespite the infeasibility of an exhaustive calculation of the relevant quantities and structures for a realistic system, IIT already provides considerable explanatory and predictive power in many real-world situations, making it eminently testable [4, 57, 58]. A fundamental prediction is that \\(\\Phi\\) should be high in conscious states, such as wakefulness and dreaming, and low in unconscious states, such as dreamless sleep and anesthesia. This prediction has already found substantial support in human studies that have applied measures of complexity inspired by IIT to successfully classify subjects as conscious vs. unconscious [4, 22, 23, 59]. IIT can also account mechanistically for the loss of consciousness in deep\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
