{"result": "This text appears to be a mathematical or scientific document discussing concepts related to system integrated information, partitioned transition probability matrices, and the principles of cause and effect within a system. However, it does not contain explicit references to entities of the types specified (organization, person, geo, event). The text is highly technical and focuses on theoretical and mathematical models rather than identifiable entities or events in the conventional sense. Therefore, based on the given entity types and the content of the text, no entities or relationships can be extracted according to the task's requirements.\n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

In the second case, if \\(\\delta_{i}\\in\\{\\rightarrow\\}\\), there may still be inputs to \\(S^{(i)}\\) that are cut, which correspond to the outputs of all \\(S^{(i)}\\) with \\(\\delta_{j}\\in\\{\\rightarrow,\\leftrightarrow\\}\\).\n\nGiven a partition \\(\\theta\\in\\Theta(S)\\), we define partitioned transition probability matrices \\(\\mathcal{T}_{e}^{\\theta}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}_{e}^{\\theta}\\) in which all connections affected by the partition are \"noised.\" This is done by combining the independent contributions of each unit \\(S_{j}\\in S\\) in line with the conditional independence assumption (2). For the effect TPM (and analogously for the cause TPM)\n\n\\[\\mathcal{T}_{e}^{\\theta}\\equiv p_{e}^{\\theta}(\\bar{s}\\ |\\ s)=\\prod_{j-1}^{n}p_{e}^{ \\theta}(\\bar{s}_{j}\\ |\\ s),\\ \\bar{s},s\\in\\Omega_{S}, \\tag{17}\\]\n\nwhere the partitioned probability of a unit \\(\\bar{S}_{j}\\in S^{(i)}\\) is defined as\n\n\\[p_{e}^{\\theta}(\\bar{s}_{j}\\ |\\ s)=|\\Omega_{x^{(i)}}|^{-1}\\sum_{x^{(i)}\\in \\Omega_{x^{(i)}}}p_{e}(\\bar{s}_{j}\\ |\\ x^{(i)},y^{(i)}), \\tag{18}\\]\n\nand \\(y^{(i)}=s\\backslash x^{(i)}\\). This means that all connections to unit \\(S_{j}\\) that are affected by the partition are _causally marginalized_ (replaced by independent noise).\n\nSystem integrated information \\(\\varphi_{e}\\)The integrated effect information \\(\\varphi_{e}\\) measures how much the partition \\(\\theta\\in\\Theta_{S}\\) reduces the probability with which a system \\(S\\) in state \\(s\\in\\Omega_{S}\\) specifies its effect state \\(s_{e}^{\\prime}\\) (12),\n\n\\[\\varphi_{e}(\\mathcal{T}_{e},s,\\theta)=p_{e}(s_{e}^{\\prime}\\ |\\ s)\\left|\\log \\left(\\frac{p_{e}(s_{e}^{\\prime}\\ |\\ s)}{p_{e}^{\\theta}(s_{e}^{\\prime}\\ |\\ s)}\\right)\\right|_{+}. \\tag{19}\\]\n\nNote that \\(\\varphi_{e}\\) has the same form as the intrinsic information \\(\\mathrm{ii}_{e}(s,\\bar{s})\\) (5), with the partitioned effect probability taking the place of the unconstrained (marginal) probability. Here, \\(\\left|\\right|_{+}\\) represents the positive part operator, which sets the negative values to 0. This ensures that the system as a whole raises the probability of the effect state compared to the partitioned probability. Likewise, the integrated cause information \\(\\varphi_{e}\\) is defined as\n\n\\[\\varphi_{e}(\\mathcal{T}_{e},s,\\theta)=p_{e}^{-}(s_{e}^{\\prime}\\ |\\ s)\\left|\\log \\left(\\frac{p_{e}(s\\ |\\ s_{e}^{\\prime})}{p_{e}^{\\theta}(s\\ |\\ s_{e}^{\\prime})}\\right)\\right|_{+}. \\tag{20}\\]\n\n(By the principle of maximal existence, if two or more cause-effect states are tied for maximal intrinsic information, the system specifies the one that maximizes \\(\\varphi_{c}\\)).\n\nBy the zeroth postulate, existence requires cause _and_ effect power, and the integration postulate requires that its cause-effect power be irreducible. By the principle of minimal existence (Box 2), then, system integrated information for a given partition is the minimum of its irreducibility on the cause _and_ effect sides:\n\n\\[\\varphi_{e}(\\mathcal{T}_{e},\\mathcal{T}_{e},s,\\theta)=\\min\\{\\varphi_{e}( \\mathcal{T}_{e},s,\\theta),\\varphi_{e}(\\mathcal{T}_{e},s,\\theta)\\}. \\tag{21}\\]Moreover, again by the principle of minimal existence, the integrated information of a system is given by its irreducibility over its minimum partition (MIP) \\(\\theta^{\\prime}\\in\\Theta_{\\text{S}}\\), such that\n\n\\[\\varphi_{i}(\\mathcal{T}_{{}_{e}},\\mathcal{T}_{{}_{c}},s)\\\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
