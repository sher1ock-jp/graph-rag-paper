For example, a system in a fixed point is dynamically \"dead\" (and \"does\" nothing), but it may be phenomenally quite \"alive,\" for example, experiencing \"pure presence\" (see (14) in S1 Notes). Of course, the system's causal powers can be fully unfolded, and revealed dynamically, by extensive manipulations and observations of subsets of system units because they are implicitly captured by the system's causal model and ultimately by its transition probability matrix [29].\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIIT attempts to account for the presence and quality of consciousness in physical terms. It starts from the existence of experience, and proceeds by characterizing its essential properties --those that are immediate and irrefutably true of every conceivable experience (axioms). These are then formulated as essential properties of physical existence (postulates), the necessary and sufficient conditions that a substrate must satisfy to support an experience--to constitute a complex. Note that \"substrate\" is meant in purely operational terms--as a set of units that a conscious observer can observe and manipulate. Likewise, \"physical\" is understood in purely operational terms as cause-effect power--the power to take and make a difference.\n\nThe postulates can be assessed based purely on a substrate's transition probability matrix, as was illustrated by a few idealized causal models. Thus, a substrate of consciousness must be able to take and make a difference upon itself (existence and intrinsicality), it must be able to specify a cause and an effect state that are highly informative and selective (information), and it must do so in a way that is both irreducible (integration) and definite (exclusion). Finally, it must specify its cause and effect in a structured manner (composition), where the causal powers of its subsets over its subsets compose a cause-effect structure of distinctions and relations--a \\(\\Phi\\)-structure. Thus, a complex does not exist as such but only \"unfolded\" as a \\(\\Phi\\)-structure--an _intrinsic entity_ that exists for itself, absolutely, rather than relative to an external observer.\n\nAs shown above, these requirements constrain what substrates can and cannot support consciousness. Substrates that lack in specificity, due to indeterminism and/or degeneracy, cannot grow to be large complexes. Substrates that are weakly integrated, due to architectural or functional fault lines in their interactions, are less integrated than some of their subsets. Because they are not maximally irreducible, they do not qualify as complexes. This is the case even though they may \"hang together\" well enough from an extrinsic perspective (having a respectable value of \\(\\varphi_{\\text{s}}\\)). Furthermore, even substrates that are maximally integrated may support \\(\\Phi\\)-structures that are extremely sparse, as in the case of directed cycles. Based on the postulates of IIT, a universal substrate ultimately \"condenses\" into a set of disjoint (non-overlapping) complexes, each constituted of a set of macro or micro units.\n\nThe physical account of consciousness provided by IIT should be understood as an explanatory identity: every property of an experience should ultimately be accounted for by a property of the cause-effect structure specified by a substrate that satisfies its postulates, with no additional ingredients. The identity is not between two different substances or realms--the phenomenal and the physical--but between intrinsic (subjective) existence and extrinsic (objective) existence. Intrinsic existence is immediate and irrefutable, while extrinsic existence is defined operationally as cause-effect power discovered through observation and manipulation. The primacy of intrinsic existence (of experience) in IIT contrasts with standard attempts at accounting for consciousness as something \"generated by\" or \"emerging from\" a substrate constituted of matter and energy and following physical laws.\n\nThe physical correspondent of an experience is not the substrate as such but the \\(\\Phi\\)-structure specified by the substrate in its current state. Therefore, minor changes in the substrate state can correspond to major changes in the specified \\(\\Phi\\)-structure. For example, if the state of a single unit changes, an entire \\(\\Phi\\)-fold within the \\(\\Phi\\)-structure will change, and if a single inactive unit is inactivated, its associated \\(\\Phi\\)-fold will collapse, even though the current state of the substrate appears the same (Fig.7).\n\nEach experience corresponds to a \\(\\Phi\\)-structure, not a set of functions, processes, or computations. Said otherwise, consciousness is about being, not doing [1, 29, 55]. This means that systems with different architectures may be functionally equivalent--both in terms of global input-output functions and global intrinsic dynamics--but they will not be phenomenally equivalent. For example, a feed-forward system can be functionally equivalent to a recurrent system that constitutes a complex, but feed-forward systems cannot constitute complexes because they do not satisfy maximal irreducibility. Accordingly, artificial systems powered by super-intelligent computer programs, but implemented by feed-forward hardware or encompassing critical bottlenecks, would experience nothing (or nearly nothing) because they have the wrong kind of physical architecture, even though they may be behaviorally indistinguishable from human beings [20].\n\nEven though the entire framework of IIT is based on just a few axioms and postulates, it is not possible in practice to exhaustively apply the postulates to unfold the cause-effect power of realistic systems [32, 56]. It is not feasible to perform all possible observations and manipulations to fully characterize a universal TPM, or to perform\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
