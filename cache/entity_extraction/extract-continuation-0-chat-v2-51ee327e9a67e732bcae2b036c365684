IIT aims to account for the properties of experience in physical (operational) terms. It identifies the essential properties of experience (axioms), infers the necessary and sufficient properties that its substrate must satisfy (postulates), and expresses them in mathematical terms. In principle, the postulates can be applied to any system of units in a state to determine whether it is conscious, to what degree, and in what way. IIT offers a parsimonious explanation of empirical evidence, makes testable predictions concerning both the presence and the quality of experience, and permits inferences and extrapolations. IIT 4.0 incorporates several developments of the past ten years, including a more accurate formulation of the axioms as postulates and mathematical expressions, the introduction of a unique measure of intrinsic information that is consistent with the postulates, and an explicit assessment of causal relations. By fully unfolding a system's irreducible cause-effect power, the distinctions and relations specified by a substrate can account for the quality of experience.\n\n## Author summary\n\nAs a theory of consciousness, IIT aims to answer two questions: 1) Why is experience present vs. absent? and 2) Why do specific experiences feel the way they do? The theory's starting point is the existence of experience. IIT then aims to account for phenomenal existence and its essential properties in physical terms. It concludes that a substrate--a set of interacting units--can support consciousness if it can take and make a difference for itself (intrinsicality), select a specific cause and effect as an irreducible whole with a Wisconsin-Madison, by the Tiny Blue Dot Foundation (IWT 133AGAG345I; G.T.), and by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (MSERC, GRIPN-2019-05418; W.M.). L. A. also acknowledges the support of a grant from the Templeton World Charity Foundation (TWGF-2020-20526, L.A.). The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.\n\n### Competing interests:\n\nI have read the journal's policy and the authors of this manuscript have the following competing interests: G.T. holds an executive position and has a financial interest in Intrinsic Powers, Inc., a company whose purpose is to develop a device that can be used in the clinic to assess the presence and absence of consciousness in patients. This does not pose any conflict of interest with regard to the work undertaken for this publication.\n\nIIT aims to account for phenomenal properties--the properties of experience--in physical terms. IIT's starting point is experience itself rather than its behavioral, functional, or neural correlates [1]. Furthermore, in IIT \"physical\" is meant in a strictly operational sense--in terms of what can be observed and manipulated.\n\nThe starting point of IIT is the existence of an experience, which is immediate and irrefutable [3]. From this \"zeroth\" axiom, IIT sets out to identify the essential properties of consciousness--those that are immediate and irrefutably true of every conceivable experience. These are IIT's five axioms of phenomenal existence: every experience is for the experiencer (intrinsically), specific (information), unitary (integration), definite (exclusion), and structured (composition).\n\nUnlike phenomenal existence, which is immediate and irrefutable (an axiom), physical existence is an explanatory construct (a postulate), and it is assessed operationally (from within consciousness): in physical terms, to be is to have cause-effect power. In other words, something can be said to exist physically if it can \"take and make a difference\"--bear a cause and produce an effect--as judged by a conscious observer/manipulator.\n\nThe next step of IIT is to formulate the essential phenomenal properties (the axioms) in terms of corresponding physical properties (the postulates). This formulation is an \"inference to a good explanation\" and rests on basic assumptions such as realism, physicalism, and atomism (see Box 1: Methodological guidelines of IIT). If IIT is correct, the substrate of consciousness (see (1) in S1 Notes), beyond having cause-effect power (existence), must satisfy all five essential phenomenal properties in physical terms: its cause-effect power must be for itself (intrinsicality), specific (information), unitary (integration), definite (exclusion), and structured (composition).\n\nOn this basis, IIT proposes a fundamental explanatory identity: an experience is identical to the cause-effect structure unfolded from a maximal substrate (defined below). Accordingly, all the specific phenomenal properties of any experience must have a good explanation in terms of the specific physical properties of the corresponding cause-effect structure, with no additional ingredients.\n\nBased again on \"inferences to a good explanation\" (see Box 1), IIT formulates the postulates in a mathematical framework that is in principle applicable to general models of interacting units (but see (2) in S1 Notes). A mathematical framework is needed (\\(a\\)) to evaluate whether the theory is self-consistent and compatible with our overall knowledge about the world, (\\(b\\)) to make specific predictions regarding the quality and quantity of our experiences and their substrate within the brain, and (_c_) to extrapolate from our own consciousness to infer the presence (or absence) and nature of consciousness in beings different from ourselves.\n\nUltimately, the theory should account for why our consciousness depends on certain portions of the world and their state, such as certain regions of the brain and not others, and for why it fades during dreamless sleep, even though the brain remains active. It should also account for why an experience feels the way it does--why the sky feels extended, why a melody feels flowing in time\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>\"Integrated Information Theory (IIT) 4.0\"<|>\"organization\"<|>\"IIT 4.0 is a theory aiming to account for the properties of experience in physical terms, identifying essential properties of experience, inferring necessary properties for its substrate, and expressing these in mathematical terms.
