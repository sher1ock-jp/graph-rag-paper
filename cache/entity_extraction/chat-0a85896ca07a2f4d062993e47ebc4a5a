The cause-effect structures derived from these simple networks only serve as convenient illustrations of how a hypothetical substrate's cause-effect power can be unfolded.\n\n### Implementing the postulates\n\nIn what follows, our goal is to evaluate whether a hypothetical substrate (also called \"system\") satisfies all the postulates of IIT. To that end, we must verify whether the system has cause-effect power that is intrinsic, specific, integrated, definite, and structured.\n\n**Existence.** According to IIT, existence understood as cause-effect power requires the capacity to both take _and_ make a difference (see Box 2, Principle of being). On the basis of a complete description of the system in terms of interventional conditional probabilities (\\(\\mathcal{T}_{{}_{U}}\\)) (1), cause-effect power can be quantified as causal _informativeness_. Cause informativeness measures how much a potential cause increases the probability of the current state, and effect informativeness how much the current state increases the probability of a potential effect (as compared to chance).\n\nIntrinsicality.Building upon the existence postulate, the intrinsicality postulate further requires that a system exerts cause-effect power _within itself_. In general, the systems we want to evaluate are open systems \\(S\\subseteq U\\) that are part of a larger \"universe\" \\(U\\). From the intrinsic perspective of a system \\(S\\) (see Box 1), the set of the remaining units \\(W=U\\Im\\) merely act as background conditions that do not contribute directly to cause-effect power. To enforce this, we causally marginalize the background units, conditional on the current state of the universe, rendering them causally inert (see \"Identifying substrates of consciousness\" for details).\n\nInformation.The information postulate requires that a system's cause-effect power be specific: the system in its current state must select a specific cause-effect state for its units. Based on the _principle of maximal existence_ (Box 2), this is the state for which intrinsic information is maximal--the _maximal cause-effect state_. _Intrinsic information_ (ii) measures the difference a system takes or makes over itself for a given cause and effect state as the product of\n\nFigure 1: **Identifying substrates of consciousness through the postulates of existence, intrinsicity, information, integration, and exclusion.** (A) The substrate \\(S=aBC\\) in state (\\(-1,1,1\\)) (lowercase letters for units indicated state \\({}^{*}-1\\),\u201d uppercase letters state \\({}^{*}+1\\)) is the starting point for applying the postulates. The substrate updates its state according to the depicted transition probability matrix (TPM) (gray shading indicates probability value from white (p = 0) to black (p = 1); each unit follows a logistic equation (see \u201cResults\u201d for definition) with \\(k=4.0\\) and connection weights as indicated in the causal model). Existence requires that the substrate must have cause-effect power, meaning that the TPM among substrate states must differ from chance. (B) Intrinsicity requires that a candidate substrate, for example, units \\(aB\\), has cause\u2013effect power over itself. Units outside the candidate substrate (in this case, unit \\(C\\)) are treated as background conditions. The corresponding cause and effect TPMs (\\(T_{a}\\) and \\(T_{a}\\)) of system \\(aB\\) are depicted on the right. (C) Information requires that the candidate substrate \\(aB\\) selects a specific cause\u2013effect state (\\(\\mathcal{V}\\)). This is the cause\u2013effect state (red) and effect state (green) for which intrinsic information (ii) is maximal. Bar plots on the right indicate the three probability terms relevant for computing it (\\(\\mathcal{V}\\)) and the \\(\\mathcal{V}\\): the selectivity (light colored bar), as well as the constrained (dark colored bar) and unconstrained (gray bar) effect probabilities in the informativeness term. (D) Integration requires that the substrate specifies its cause\u2013effect state irreducibly (\u201das one\u201d). This is established by identifying the minimum partition (MIP; \\(\\mathcal{V}\\)) and measuring the integrated information of the system (\\(\\varphi_{*}\\))\u2014the minimum between cause integrated information (\\(\\varphi_{*}\\)) and effect integrated information (\\(\\varphi_{*}\\)). Here, gray bars represent the partitioned probability required for computing \\(\\varphi_{*}\\) (20) and \\(\\varphi_{*}\\) (19). (E) Exclusion requires that the substrate of consciousness is definite, including some units and excluding others. This is established by identifying the candidate substrate with the maximum value of system integrated information (\\(\\varphi_{*}\\))\u2014the maximal substrate, or complex. In this case, \\(aB\\) is a complex since its system integrated information (\\(\\varphi_{*}=0.17\\)) is higher than that of all other overlapping systems (for example, subset \\(a\\) with \\(\\varphi_{*}=0.04\\) and superset \\(aBC\\) with \\(\\varphi_{*}=0.13\\)).\n\ninformativeness and selectivity. As we have seen (existence), _informativeness_ quantifies the causal power of a system in its current state as a reduction of uncertainty with respect to chance. _Selectivity_ measures how much cause-effect power is concentrated over that specific cause or effect state. Selectivity is reduced by uncertainty in the cause or effect state with respect to\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
