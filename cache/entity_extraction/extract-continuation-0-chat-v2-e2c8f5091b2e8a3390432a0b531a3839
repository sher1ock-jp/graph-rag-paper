Instead, a unit contributes an entire sub-structure, composed of a very large number of distinctions and relations. The set of distinctions to which a subset of units contributes as a mechanism, either alone or in combination with other units, together with their associated relations, forms a compound \\(\\Phi\\)-fold. With respect to the neural substrate of consciousness in the brain, this means that even a change in the state of a single unit is typically associated with a change in an entire \\(\\Phi\\)-fold within the overall \\(\\Phi\\)-structure, with a corresponding change in the structure of the experience. (Note, however, that in larger systems such changes will typically be less extreme, see also [11].).\n\nIn Fig 7C, we see what happens if unit \\(E\\), instead of just turning inactive (OFF) is _inactivated_ (abolishing its cause-effect power because it no longer has any counterfactual states and thus cannot be intervened upon). In this case, all the distinctions and relations to which that unit contributes as a mechanism would cease to exist (its compound \\(\\Phi\\)-fold collapses). Moreover, all the distinctions and relations to whose purviews that unit contributes--its purview \\(\\Phi\\)-fold --would also collapse or change. In fact, the complex shrinks because it cannot include that unit. With respect to the neural substrate of consciousness, this means that while an inactive unit contributes to a different experience, an inactivated unit ceases to contribute to experience altogether. The fundamental difference between inactive and inactivated units leads to the \n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:35]\n\nfollowing corollary of IIT: unlike a fully inactivated substrate which, as would be suspected, cannot support any experience, an inactive substrate can. If a maximal substrate in an inactive state is in working order and specifies a large \\(\\Phi\\)-structure, it will support a highly structured experience, such as the experience of empty space [11] or the feeling of \"pure presence\" (see (14) in S1Notes).\n\n### Consciousness and functional equivalence: Being is not doing\n\nBy the intrinsicality postulate, the \\(\\Phi\\)-structure of a complex depends on the causal interactions between system subsets, not on the system's interaction with its environment (except for the role of the environment in triggering specific system states). In general, different physical systems with different internal causal structure may perform the same input-output functions.\n\nFig 8 shows three simple deterministic systems with binary units (here the \"OFF\" state is 0, and \"ON\" is 1) that perform the same input-output function, treating the internal dynamics of the system as a black box. The function could be thought of, for example, as an electronic toll-booth \"counting 8 valid coins\" (8 times input \\(I=1\\)) before opening the gate [53]. Each system receives one binary input (\\(I\\)) and has one binary output (\\(O\\)). The output unit switches \"ON\" on a count of eight positive inputs \\(I=1\\) (when the global state with label '0' is reached in the cycle), upon which the system resets (Fig 8A).\n\nIn addition to being functionally equivalent in their outward behavior, the three systems share the same internal global dynamics, as their internal states update according to the same global state-transition diagram (Fig 8B). Given an input \\(I=1\\), the system updates its state, cycling through all its 8 global states (labeled 0-7) over 8 updates. For an input of \\(I=0\\), the system remains in its present state. Moreover, all three systems are constituted of three binary units whose joint states map one-to-one onto the systems' global state labels (0-7). However, the mapping is different for different systems (Fig 8C, left). This is because the internal binary update sequence depends on the interactions among the internal units [29, 53], which differ in the three cases, as can easily be determined through manipulations and observations.\n\nFor consistency in the causal powers analysis, in all three cases, the global state \"0\" that activates the output unit if \\(I=1\\) is selected such that it corresponds to the binary state \"all OFF\" (000), which is followed by \\(1\\coloneqq 100\\) and \\(2\\coloneqq 010\\). Also, the \\(\\Phi\\)-structure of each system is unfolded in state \\(1\\coloneqq 100\\) in all three cases.\n\nDespite their functional equivalence and equivalent global dynamics, the systems differ in how they condense into complexes and in the cause-effect structures they specify.\n\nAs shown in Fig 8C, the first system forms a 3-unit complex with a relatively rich \\(\\Phi\\)-structure (\\(\\Phi\\) = 21.01 ibits). While the second system also forms a 3-unit complex with the same \\(\\varphi_{s}=2\\) ibits, it specifies a completely different set of distinctions and has much lower structure integrated information (\\(\\Phi\\) = 3.64 ibits).\n\nFinally, the third system is reducible (\\(\\varphi_{s}=0\\) ibits)--in this case, because there are only feed-forward connections from unit \\(A\\) to units \\(B\\) and \\(C\\)--and it condenses into three complexes with small \\(\\Phi\\)-structures.\n\nThese examples illustrate a simple scenario of functional equivalence of three systems characterized by a different architecture. The equivalence is with respect to a simple input-outputfunction, in this case coin counting, which they multiply realize. The systems are also equivalent in terms of their global system dynamics, in\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>\"\\(\\Phi\\)-fold\"<|>\"Knowledge\"<|>\"A \\(\\Phi\\)-fold represents a complex structure within the neural substrate of consciousness, comprising a large number of distinctions and relations contributed by a subset of units.
