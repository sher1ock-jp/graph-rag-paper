This model leverages Bayesian filtering techniques to continuously update the decoding parameters based on the user's neural activity, thereby improving the accuracy and responsiveness of the BCI system. The study also utilized the Neural Signal Processing Toolkit (NSPT) for pre-processing large datasets of intracortical signals, which were then used to train the DSSM.

This technique modifies only a small subset of parameters within the model, resulting in significant computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. A paper published by Dr. Chen's team at the AI Research Institute demonstrated that applying LoRA to a 175 billion parameter model reduced the number of trainable parameters by over 90%, while maintaining over 98% of the model's original performance on the GLUE benchmark. The study utilized the OpenAI GPT-3 architecture as the base model and introduced a novel adaptation method called Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) that further optimizes the adaptation process by combining LoRA with sparse regularization techniques. The experiments conducted used the Common Crawl dataset for pre-training and the SQuAD dataset for fine-tuning.

Accordingly, the maximal substrate, or complex, is the candidate substrate with the maximum value of system integrated information (\\(\\varphi_{i}\\)), and overlapping substrates with lower \\(\\varphi_{s}\\) are thus excluded from existence.\n\n**Determining maximal substrates recursively.** Within a universal substrate \\(U_{0}\\) in state \\(u_{0}\\), subsets of units that specify maxima of irreducible cause-effect power (complexes) can be identified iteratively: the substrate with maximum \\(\\varphi_{i}^{*}\\) is identified as a complex, the corresponding units are excluded from further consideration, the remaining units are searched for the next maximal substrate. Formally, an iterative search is performed to find a sequence of systems \\(S_{k}^{*}\\subseteq U_{k}\\) with\n\n\\[\\varphi_{i}^{*}(\\mathcal{T}_{e},\\mathcal{T}_{c},u_{k})=\\max_{S_{k}^{*}\\subseteq U _{k}}\\varphi_{i}(\\mathcal{T}_{e},\\mathcal{T}_{c},s), \\tag{24}\\]\n\nsuch that\n\n\\[S_{k}^{*}=\\operatorname*{argmax}_{S_{k}^{*}\\subseteq U_{k}}\\varphi_{i}( \\mathcal{T}_{e},\\mathcal{T}_{c},s), \\tag{25}\\]\n\nand \\(U_{k+1}=U_{k}\\backslash S_{k}^{*}\\) until \\(U_{k+1}=\\emptyset\\) or \\(U_{k+1}=U_{k}\\) (the units in \\(U_{0}U_{k+1}\\) still serve as background conditions, for details see [13]). If the maximal substrate \\(S_{k}^{*}\\) is not unique, and all tied systems overlap, the next best system that is unique is chosen instead (see S1Text).\n\nFor any complex \\(S^{*}\\) in its corresponding state \\(s^{*}\\in\\Omega_{S^{*}}\\), overlapping substrates that specify less integrated information (\\(\\varphi_{i}<\\varphi_{i}(\\mathcal{T}_{e},\\mathcal{T}_{c},s^{*})\\)) are excluded. Consequently, specifying a maximum of integrated information \\(\\varphi_{i}^{*}\\) compared to all overlapping systems\n\n\\[S\\cap\\bar{S}\\neq\\emptyset\\Rightarrow\\varphi_{i}(s)>\\varphi_{i}(\\bar{s}),\\ \\ \\forall S\\neq\\bar{S}\\subseteq U \\tag{26}\\]\n\nis a sufficient requirement for a system \\(S\\subseteq U\\) to be a complex.\n\nAs described in [13], this recursive search for maximal substrates \"condenses\" the universe \\(U_{0}\\) in state \\(u_{0}\\in\\Omega_{U_{0}}\\) into a disjoint (non-overlapping) and exhaustive set of complexes--the first complex, second complex, and so on.\n\nDetermining maximal unit grains.Above, we presented how to determine the borders of a complex within a larger system \\(U\\), assuming a particular grain for the units \\(U_{i}\\in U\\). In principle, however, all possible grains should be considered [33, 34]. In the brain, for example, the grain of units could be brain regions, groups of neurons, individual neurons, sub-cellular structures, molecules, atoms, quarks, or anything finer, down to hypothetical atomic units of cause-effect power [3, 4]. For any unit grain--neurons, for example--the grain of updates could be minutes, seconds, milliseconds, micro-seconds, and so on. However, by the exclusion postulate, the units that constitute a system \\(S\\) must also be definite, in the sense of having a definite grain.\n\nOnce again, the grain is defined by the principle of maximal existence: across the possible micro- and macroscopic levels, the \"winning\" grain is the one that ensures maximally irreducible existence (\\(\\varphi_{i}^{*}\\)) for the entity to which the units belong [33, 34].\n\nTo evaluate integrated information across grains requires a mathematical framework for defining coarser (macro) units from finer (micro) units. Such a framework has been developed in previous work [33, 34, 35], and is updated here to fully align with the postulates.\n\nSupposing that \\(U=u\\) is a universe of micro units in a state, a macro unit \\(J=j\\) is a combination of a set of micro units \\(\\hat{S}\\subseteq U\\), and a mapping \\(g\\) from the state \\(\\hat{S}\\) to the state of \\(J\\),\n\n\\[j=g(\\hat{s}),\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[g:\\Omega_{\\hat{s}}\\rightarrow\\Omega_{J}.\\]\n\nAs constituents of a complex upon which its cause-effect power rests, the units themselves should comply with the postulates of IIT. Otherwise it would be possible to \"make something out of nothing.\" Accordingly, units themselves must also be maximally irreducible, as measured by the integrated information of the units when they are treated as candidate systems (\\(\\varphi_{i}\\)); otherwise, they would not be units but \"disintegrate\" into their constituents. However, in contrast to systems, units only need to be maximally irreducible _within_, because they do not exist as complexes in their own right: a unit \\(J\\) with substrate \\(\\hat{S}\\) qualifies as a candidate unit of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
