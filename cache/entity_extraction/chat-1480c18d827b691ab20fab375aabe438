A fundamental prediction is that \\(\\Phi\\) should be high in conscious states, such as wakefulness and dreaming, and low in unconscious states, such as dreamless sleep and anesthesia. This prediction has already found substantial support in human studies that have applied measures of complexity inspired by IIT to successfully classify subjects as conscious vs. unconscious [4, 22, 23, 59]. IIT can also account mechanistically for the loss of consciousness in deep sleep and anesthesia [4, 47]. Furthermore, it can provide a principled account of why certain portions of the brain may constitute an ideal substrate of consciousness and others may not, why the borders of the main complex in the brain should be where they are, and why the units of the complex should have a particular grain (the one that yields a maximum of \\(\\varphi_{*}\\)). A stringent prediction is that the location of the main complex, as determined by the overall maximum of \\(\\varphi_{*}\\) within the brain, should correspond to its location as determined through clinical and experimental evidence.\n\nAnother prediction that follows from first principles is that constituents of the main complex can support conscious contents even if they are mostly inactive, but not if they are inactivated [4, 11]. Yet another prediction is that the complete inactivation of constituents of the main complex should lead to absolute agnosia (unawareness that anything is missing).\n\nIIT further predicts that the quality of experience should be accounted for by the way the \\(\\Phi\\)-structure is composed, which in turn depends on the architecture of the substrate specifying it. This was demonstrated in a recent paper showing how the fundamental properties of spatial experiences--those that make space feel \"extended\"--can be accounted for by those of \\(\\Phi\\)-structures specified by 2D grids of units, such as those found in much of posterior cortex [11]. This prediction is in line with neurological evidence of their role in supporting the experience of space [11]. Ongoing work aims at accounting for the quality of experienced time and that of experienced objects (see (16) in S1 Notes). A related prediction is that changes in the strength of connections within the neural substrate of consciousness should be associated with changes in experience, even if neural activity does not change [60]. Also, similarities and dissimilarities in the structure of experience should be accounted for by similarities and dissimilarities among \\(\\Phi\\)-structures and \\(\\Phi\\)-folds specified by the neural substrate of consciousness.\n\nWhile the listed predictions may appear largely qualitative in nature, many of them rest on specific features of the accompanying quantitative analysis. This is the case for predictions regarding the borders (and grain) of the main complex in the brain, which depend on the relative \\(\\varphi_{s}\\) values of potential substrates of interest, and even more so for predictions regarding the quality and richness of certain experiences and the predicted features of their underlying substrates. IIT's postulates, and the mathematical framework proposed to evaluate them, rest on \"inferences to a good explanation\" (Box1). While we have aimed for maximal consistency, specificity, and simplicity at every junction in formulating IIT's mathematical implementation, some of the algorithmic choices remain open to further evaluation. These include, for example, the proper treatment of background conditions and the resolution of ties given symmetries in the TPMs of specific systems (see S1 Text). More generally, further validation of IIT will depend on a systematic back-and-forth between phenomenology, theoretical inferences, and neuroscientific evidence [1].\n\nIn addition to empirical work aimed at validating the theory, much remains to be done at the theoretical level. According to IIT, the meaning of an experience is its feeling--whether those of spatial extendedness, of temporal flow, or of objects, to name but a few (\"the meaning is the feeling\"). This means that every meaning is identical to a sub-structure within a current \\(\\Phi\\)-structure--a content of experience--whether it is triggered by extrinsic inputs or it occurs spontaneously during a dream. Therefore, all meaning is ultimately intrinsic. Ongoing work aims at providing a self-consistent explanation of how intrinsic meanings can capture relevant features of causal processes in the environment (see (17) in S1 Notes). It will also be important to explain how intersubjectively validated knowledge can be obtained despite the intrinsic and partially idiosyncratic nature of meaning.\n\nTo the extent that the theory is validated through empirical evidence obtained from the human brain, IIT can then offer a plausible inferential basis for addressing several questions that depend on an explicit theory of consciousness. As indicated in the section on phenomenal and functional equivalence, and argued in ongoing work [20], one consequence of IIT is that typical computer architectures are not suitable for supporting consciousness, no matter whether their behavior may resemble ours. By the same token, it can be inferred from IIT that animal species that may look and behave quite differently from us may be highly conscious, as long as their brains have a compatible architecture. Other inferences concern our own experience and whether it plays a causal role, or is simply \"along for the ride\" while our brain performs its functions. As recently argued, IIT implies that we have true free will--that we have true alternatives, make true decisions, and truly cause. Because only what truly exists (intrinsically, for itself) can truly cause, we, rather than our neurons, cause our willed actions and are responsible for their consequences [18].\n\nFinally, an ontology that is grounded in experience as intrinsic existence--an intrinsic ontology--must not only provide an account of subjective existence in objective, operational terms, but also offer a path toward a unified view of nature--of all that exists and happens. One step in this direction is the application of the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
