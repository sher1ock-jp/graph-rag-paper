The maximal overlap \\(o^{*}(\\mathbf{z})\\) (50) is also called the \"face purview.\" The set of faces associated with a relation thus specifies which type of relation it is (e.g., a single-faceted relation that only relates the causes of the set of distinctions, or a multi-faceted relation, which requires some of the distinctions to overlap on both the cause and effect side). Note that (49) includes the case \\(\\mathbf{z}=\\{z^{*}_{\\epsilon}(d),z^{*}_{\\epsilon}(d)\\}\\), which indicates a \"self-relation\" over the cause and effect of a single distinction \\(d\\in D(s)\\).\n\nA relation \\(r(\\mathbf{d})\\) thus consists of a set of distinctions \\(\\mathbf{d}\\in D(s)\\), with an associated set of faces \\(\\mathbf{f(d)}=\\{\\mathbf{f(z)}\\}_{d}\\) and irreducibility \\(\\varphi_{r}>0\\),\n\n\\[r(\\mathbf{d})=(\\mathbf{d},\\mathbf{f(d)},\\varphi_{r}). \\tag{51}\\]\n\nA relation that binds together \\(h=|\\mathbf{d}|\\) distinctions is a \\(h\\)-degree relation. A relation face \\(\\mathbf{f(z)}\\in\\mathbf{f(d)}\\)\n\nFigure 3: **Composition of intrinsic effects.** From the intrinsic perspective of the system, a specific cause or effect is only available to the system if it is selected by a causal distinction \\(d\\in D(s)\\). In (A), only the top-order effect is specified. From the intrinsic perspective, the system cannot distinguish the individual units. In (B), only first-order effects are specified. The system has no \u201chandle\u201d to select all three units together. (C) If both first- and third-order effects are specified, but no second-order effects, the system can distinguish individual units and select them together, but has no way of ordering them sequentially. (D) The system can distinguish individual units, select them altogether, as well as order them sequentially, in the sense that it has a handle for \\(ab\\) and \\(bc\\), but not \\(ac\\). The ordering becomes apparent once the relations among the distinctions are considered (see below, Fig.5).\n\nconsists of a set of causes and effects \\(\\mathbf{z}\\) (as in 49), with associated face purview \\(o^{*}(\\mathbf{z})\\) (50)\n\n\\[f(\\mathbf{z})=(\\mathbf{z},o^{*}(\\mathbf{z})). \\tag{52}\\]\n\nA relation face over \\(k=|\\mathbf{z}|\\) purviews is a \\(k\\)-degree face. The set of faces includes all the ways in which the set of distinctions \\(\\mathbf{d}\\) counts as related according to (49). Because \\(\\mathbf{z}\\) may include either the cause, or the effect, or both the cause and effect of a distinction \\(d\\in\\mathbf{d}\\), a relation \\(r(\\mathbf{d})\\) with \\(|\\mathbf{d}|>1\\) may comprise up to \\(3^{|\\mathbf{d}|}\\) faces. If a set of distinctions \\(\\mathbf{d}\\in D(s)\\) does not overlap congruently, it is not related (in that case \\(o^{*}(\\mathbf{z})=\\delta\\) for all possible \\(f(\\mathbf{z})\\in f(\\mathbf{d})\\)) (Fig.5).\n\nCausal relations inherit existence from the cause-effect power of the distinctions that compose them. They inherit intrinsicity because the causes and effects that compose their faces are specified within the substrate. Moreover, relations are specific because the joint purviews of their faces must be congruent for all causes and effects \\(z^{*}\\in\\mathbf{z}\\). Note that relation purviews are necessarily congruent with the overall cause and effect state specified by the system as a whole, because the causes and effects of the distinctions composing a relation must themselves be congruent.\n\nThe irreducibility of a causal relation is measured by \"unbinding\" distinctions from their joint purviews, taking into account all faces of the relation. Distinctions \\(d\\in D(s)\\) are already established as maximally irreducible components, characterized by their value of integrated information \\(\\varphi_{d}\\). To assess the irreducibility of a relation, we thus assume that the integrated information \\(\\varphi_{d}\\) of a distinction is distributed uniformly across unique cause and effect purview units, such that\n\n\\[\\frac{\\varphi_{d}}{|z^{*}_{(}d)\\cup z^{*}_{(}d)|} \\tag{53}\\]\n\nis the average irreducible information \\(\\varphi_{d}\\) per unique purview unit for an individual distinction \\(d\\in\\mathbf{d}\\) with cause-effect state \\(z^{*}(d)=\\{z^{*}_{(}d),z^{\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
