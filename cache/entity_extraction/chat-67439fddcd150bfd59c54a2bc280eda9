While many subsystems within the specialized network have positive values of system integrated information \\(\\varphi_{s}\\) the full 6-unit system is the maximal substrate (excluding all its subsets from being maximal substrates). Out of 63 possible distinctions, the \\(\\Phi\\)-structure comprises 27 distinctions with causes and effects congruent with the system's maximal cause-effect state. Consequently, the full 6-unit system also specifies a much larger number of causal relations compared to the copy cycle system.\n\nPreliminary work indicates that lattices of specialized units, implementing different input-output functions, but partially overlapping in their inputs (receptive field) and outputs (projective fields), are particularly well suited to constituting large substrates that unfold into extraordinarily rich \\(\\Phi\\)-structures. The number of distinctions specified by an optimally connected, specialized system is bounded above by \\(2^{n}\\)-1, and that of the relations among as many distinctions is bounded by \\(2^{(n-1)}-1\\). The structure integrated information of such structures is correspondingly large [50].\n\nIn the brain, a large part of the cerebral cortex, especially its posterior regions, is organized as a dense, divergent-convergent hierarchical 3D lattice of specialized units, which makes it a plausible candidate for the substrate of human consciousness [4, 11, 51, 52]. Note that directed cycles originating and ending in such lattices typically remain excluded from the first-maximal complex because minimal partitions across such cycles yield a much lower value of \\(\\varphi_{s}\\) compared to minimal partitions across large lattices.\n\n**Near-maximal substrates, extrinsic entities, and exclusion.** Finally, Fig. 6E shows a network of six units, four of which (_Aberf_) constitute a specialized lattice that corresponds to the first complex. Though integrated, the full set of 6 units happens to be slightly less irreducible (\\(\\varphi_{s}=0.15\\)) than one of its 4-unit subsets (\\(\\varphi_{s}=0.27\\)). From the extrinsic perspective, the 6-unit system undoubtedly behaves as a highly integrated whole (nearly as much as its 4-unit subset), one that could produce complex input-output functions due to its rich internal structure. From the intrinsic perspective of the system, however, only the 4-unit subset satisfies all the postulates of existence, including maximal irreducibility (accounting for the definite nature of experience). In this example, the remaining units form a second complex with low \\(\\varphi_{s}\\) and serve as background conditions for the first complex.\n\nA similar situation may occur in the brain. The brain as a whole is undoubtedly integrated (not to mention that it is integrated with the body as a whole), and neural \"traffic\" is heavy throughout. However, its anatomical organization may be such that a subset of brain regions, arranged in a dense 3D lattice primarily located in posterior cortex, may achieve a much higher value of integrated information than any other subset. Those regions would then constitute the first complex (the \"main complex,\" [4]), and the remaining regions might condense into a large number of much smaller complexes.\n\nTaken together, the examples in Fig 6 demonstrate that the connectivity among the units of a system has a strong impact on what set of units can constitute a complex and thereby on the structure integrated information it can specify. The examples also demonstrate the role played by the various requirements that must be satisfied by a substrate of consciousness: existence (causal power), intrinsicality, specificity, maximal irreducibility (integration and exclusion), and composition (structure).\n\n### Consciousness and activity: Active, inactive, and inactivated units\n\nA substrate exerts cause-effect power in its current state. For the same substrate, changing the state of even one unit may have major consequences on the distinctions and relations that compose its \\(\\Phi\\)-structure: many may be lost, or gained, and many may change their value of irreducibility (\\(\\varphi_{d}\\) and \\(\\varphi_{r}\\)).\n\nFig.7 shows a network of five binary units that interact through excitatory and inhibitory connections (weights indicated in the figure). The system is initially in state \\(s=ABcdE\\) (Fig 7A) and is a maximal substrate with \\(\\varphi_{s}=1.1\\) bits and a \\(\\Phi\\)-structure composed of 23 distinctions and their 13740 relations.\n\nIf we change the state of unit \\(E\\) from ON to OFF (in neural terms, the unit becomes inactive), the distinctions that the unit contributes to when ON, as well as the associated relations, may change (Fig 7B). In the case illustrated by the Figure, what changes are the purviews and irreducibility of several distinctions and associated relations, the number of distinctions stays the same, \\(\\varphi_{s}\\) changes only slightly, but the number of relations is lower, leading to a lower \\(\\Phi\\) value. In other words, what a single unit contributes to intrinsic existence is not some small \"bit\" of information. Instead, a unit contributes an entire sub-structure, composed of a very large number of distinctions and relations. The set of distinctions to which a subset of units contributes as a mechanism, either alone or in combination with other units, together with their associated relations, forms a compound \\(\\Phi\\)-fold. With respect to the neural substrate of consciousness in the brain, this means that even a change in the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
