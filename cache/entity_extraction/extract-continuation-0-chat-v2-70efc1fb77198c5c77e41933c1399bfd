As we have seen (existence), _informativeness_ quantifies the causal power of a system in its current state as a reduction of uncertainty with respect to chance. _Selectivity_ measures how much cause-effect power is concentrated over that specific cause or effect state. Selectivity is reduced by uncertainty in the cause or effect state with respect to other potential cause and effect states.\n\nFrom the intrinsic perspective of the system, the product of informativeness and selectivity leads to a tension between _expansion_ and _dilution_, whereby a system comprising more units may show increased deviation from chance but decreased concentration of cause-effect power over a specific state [12, 14].\n\n**Integration.** By the integration postulate, it is not sufficient for a system to have cause-effect power within itself and select a specific cause-effect state: it must also specify its maximal cause-effect state in a way that is irreducible. This can be assessed by _partitioning_ the set of units that constitute the system into separate parts. The system integrated information (\\(\\varphi_{s}\\)) then quantifies how much the intrinsic information specified by the maximal state is reduced due to the partition (see (8) in S1Notes). Integrated information is evaluated over the partition that makes the least difference, the _minimum partition_ (MIP), in accordance with the _principle of minimal existence_ (see Box2).\n\nIntegrated information is highly sensitive to the presence of _fault lines_--partitions that separate parts of a system that interact weakly or directionally [13].\n\n**Exclusion.** Many overlapping sets of units may have a positive value of integrated information (\\(\\varphi_{s}\\)). However, the exclusion postulate requires that the substrate of consciousness must be constituted of a definite set of units, neither less nor more. Moreover, units, updates, and states must have a definite grain. Operationally, the exclusion postulate is enforced by selecting the set of units that maximizes integrated information over itself (\\(\\varphi_{s}^{c}\\)), based again on the principle of maximal existence (see Box2). That set of units is called a _maximal substrate_, or _complex_. Over a universal substrate, sets of units for which integrated information is maximal compared to all competing candidate systems with overlapping units can be assessed recursively (by identifying the first complex, then the second complex, and so on).\n\n**Composition.** Once a complex has been identified, composition requires that we characterize its _cause-effect structure_ by considering all its subsets and fully _unfolding_ its cause-effect power.\n\nUsually, causal models are conceived in holistic terms, as state transitions of the system as a whole (1), or in reductionist terms, as a description of the individual units of the system and their interactions (2) [29]. However, to account for the structure of experience, considering only the cause-effect power of the individual units or of the system as a whole would be insufficient [17, 29]. Instead, by the composition postulate, we have to evaluate the system's cause-effect structure by considering the cause-effect power of its subsets as well as their causal relations.\n\nTo contribute to the cause-effect structure of a complex, a system subset must both take _and_ make a difference (as required by existence) _within_ the system (as required by intrinsicality). A subset \\(M\\subseteq S\\) in state \\(m\\in\\Omega_{M}\\) is called a _mechanism_ if it _links_ a cause and effect state over subsets of units \\(Z_{c_{i}c}\\subseteq S\\), called _purviews_. A mechanism together with the cause and effect state it specifies is called a _causal distinction_. Distinctions are evaluated based on whether they satisfy all the postulates of IIT (except for composition). For every mechanism, the cause-effect state is the one having maximal intrinsic information (ii), and the cause and effect purviews are those yielding the maximum value of integrated information (\\(\\varphi_{d}\\)) within the complex--that is, those that are maximally irreducible. By the information postulate, the cause-effect power of a complex must be specific, which means that it selects a specific cause-effect state at the system level. Consequently, the distinctions that exist for the complex are only those whose cause-effect state is congruent with the cause-effect state of the complex as a whole (incongruent distinctions are not components of the complex and its specific cause-effect power because they would violate the specificity postulate, according to which the experience can only be \"this one\").\n\nDistinctions whose cause or effect states overlap congruently within the system (over the same subset of units in the same state) are _bound_ together by _causal relations_. Relations also have an associated value of integrated information (\\(\\varphi_{\\eta}\\)), corresponding to their irreducibility.\n\nTogether, these distinctions and relations compose the _cause-effect structure_ of the complex in its current state. The cause-effect structure specified by a complex is called a \\(\\Phi\\)_-structure_. The sum of its distinction and relation integrated information amounts to the structure integrated information (\\(\\Phi\\)) of the complex.\n\nIn the following, we will provide a formal account of the IIT analysis. The first part demonstrates how to identify complexes. This requires that we (a) determine the cause-effect state of a system in its current state, (b) evaluate the system integrated information (\\(\\varphi_{\\eta}\\)) over that cause-effect state, and (c) search iteratively for maxima of integrated information (\\(\\varphi_{\\ast}^{\\ast}\\)) within a universe\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>\"Informativeness\"<|>\"concept\"<|>\"Informativeness quantifies the causal power of a system in its current state as a reduction of uncertainty with respect to chance.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Selectivity\"<|>\"concept\"<|>\"Selectivity measures how much cause-effect power is concentrated over a specific cause or effect state, reduced by uncertainty in the cause or effect state.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Expansion\"<|>\"concept\"<|>\"Expansion refers to a system comprising more units showing increased deviation from chance but decreased concentration of cause-effect power over a specific state.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Dilution\"<|>\"concept\"<|>\"Dilution describes the tension between expansion and the decreased concentration of cause-effect power over a specific state in a system.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Integration\"<|>\"concept\"<|>\"Integration involves specifying the maximal cause-effect state of a system in a way that is irreducible, assessed by partitioning the system into separate parts.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Fault Lines\"<|>\"concept\"<|>\"Fault lines are partitions that separate parts of a system that interact weakly or directionally, affecting integrated information.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Exclusion\"<|>\"concept\"<|>\"Exclusion requires that the substrate of consciousness be constituted of a definite set of units, with a focus on maximizing integrated information.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Maximal Substrate\"<|>\"concept\"<|>\"A maximal substrate, or complex, is a set of units for which integrated information is maximal, based on the principle of maximal existence.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Composition\"<|>\"concept\"<|>\"Composition requires characterizing the cause-effect structure of a complex by considering all its subsets and unfolding its cause-effect power.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Mechanism\"<|>\"concept\"<|>\"A mechanism links a cause and effect state over subsets of units, called purviews, and is evaluated based on its maximal intrinsic information.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Causal Distinction\"<|>\"concept\"<|>\"A causal distinction is a mechanism together with the cause and effect state it specifies, evaluated for its irreducibility within the complex.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Causal Relations\"<|>\"concept\"<|>\"Causal relations bind distinctions whose cause or effect states overlap congruently within the system, adding to the cause-effect structure of the complex.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Phi-Structure\"<|>\"concept\"<|>\"The Phi-Structure is the cause-effect structure specified by a complex, composed of its distinctions and relations integrated information.\")<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
