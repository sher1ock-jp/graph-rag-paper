It should also account for why an experience feels the way it does--why the sky feels extended, why a melody feels flowing in time, and so on. Moreover, the theory makes several predictions concerning both the presence and the quality of experience, some of which have been and are being tested empirically [4].\n\nWhile the main tenets of the theory have remained the same, its formal framework has been progressively refined and extended [5, 6, 7, 8]. Compared to IIT 1.0 [5, 6], 2.0 [7, 9], and 3.0 [8], IIT 4.0 presents a more complete, self-consistent formulation and incorporates several recent advances [10, 11, 12, 13]. Chief among them are a more accurate formulation of the axioms as postulates and mathematical expressions, the introduction of an Intrinsic Difference (ID) measure [12, 14] that is uniquely consistent with IIT's postulates, and the explicit assessment of causal relations [11].\n\nIn what follows, after introducing IIT's axioms and postulates, we provide its updated mathematical formalism. In the \"Results and discussion\" section, we apply the mathematical framework of IIT to representative examples and discuss some of their implications. The article is meant as a reference for the theory's mathematical formalism, a concise demonstration of its internal consistency, and an illustration of how a substrate's cause-effect structure is unfolded computationally. A discussion of the theory's motivation, its axioms and postulates, and its assumptions and implications can be found in a forthcoming book (see (3) in S1 Notes) and wiki [15] as well as in several publications [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. A survey of the explanatory power and experimental predictions of IIT can be found in [4]. The way IIT's analysis of cause-effect power can be applied to actual causation, or \"what caused what,\" is presented in [10].\n\n## From phenomenal axioms to physical postulates\n\n### Axioms of phenomenal existence\n\nThat experience exists--that \"there is something it is like to be\"--is immediate and irrefutable, as everybody can confirm, say, upon awakening from dreamless sleep. Phenomenal existence is immediate in the sense that my experience is simply there, directly rather than indirectly: I do not need to infer its existence from something else. It is irrefutable because the very doubting that my experience exists is itself an experience that exists--the experience of doubting [1, 3]. Thus, to claim that my experience does not exist is self-contradictory or absurd. The existence of experience is IIT's zeroth axiom.\n\n**Existence** Experience _exists_: there is _something_.\n\nTraditionally, an axiom is a statement that is assumed to be true, cannot be inferred from any other statement, and can serve as a starting point for inferences. The existence of experience is the ultimate axiom--the starting point for everything, including logic and physics.\n\nOn this basis, IIT proceeds by considering whether experience--phenomenal existence--has some axiomatic or essential properties, properties that are immediate and irrefutablely true of every conceivable experience. Drawing on introspection and reason, IIT identifies the following five:\n\n**Intrinsicity** Experience is _intrinsic_: it exists _for itself_.\n\n**Information** Experience is _specific_: it is _this one_.\n**Integration** Experience is _unitary_: it is _a whole_, irreducible to separate experiences.\n**Exclusion** Experience is _definite_: it is _this whole_.\n**Composition** Experience is _structured_: it is composed of _distinctions_ and the _relations_ that bind them together, yielding a _phenomenal structure_ that feels _the way it feels_.\n\nTo exemplify, if I awaken from dreamless sleep and experience the white wall of my room, my bed, and my body, the experience not only exists, immediately and irrefutably, but 1) it exists for me, not for something else, 2) it is specific (this one experience, not a generic one), 3) it is unitary (the left side is not experienced separately from the right side, and vice versa), 4) it is definite (it includes the visual scene in front of me--neither less, say, its left side only, nor more, say, the wall behind my head), 5) it is structured by distinctions (the wall, the bed, the body) and relations (the body is on the bed, the bed in the room), which make it feel the way it does and not some other way.\n\nThe axioms are not only immediately given, but they are irrefutably true of every conceivable experience. For example, once properly understood, the unity of experience cannot be refuted. Trying to conceive of an experience that were not unitary leads to conceiving of two separate experiences, each of which is unitary, which reaffirms the validity of the axiom. Even though each of the axioms spells out an essential property in its own right, the axioms must be considered together to properly characterize phenomenal existence.\n\nIIT takes the above set of axioms to be complete: there are no further properties of experience that are essential.
