Trying to conceive of an experience that were not unitary leads to conceiving of two separate experiences, each of which is unitary, which reaffirms the validity of the axiom. Even though each of the axioms spells out an essential property in its own right, the axioms must be considered together to properly characterize phenomenal existence.\n\nIIT takes the above set of axioms to be complete: there are no further properties of experience that are essential. Other properties that might be considered as candidates for axiomatic status include space (experience typically takes place in some spatial frame), time (an experience usually feels like it flows from a past to a future), change (an experience usually transitions or flows into another), subject-object distinction (an experience seems to involve both a subject and an object), intentionality (experiences usually refer to something in the world, or at least to something other than the subject), a sense of self (many experiences include a reference to one's body or even to one's narrative self), figure-ground segregation (an experience usually includes some object and some background), situatedness (an experience is often bound to a time and a place), will (experience offers the opportunity for action), and affect (experience is often colored by some mood), among others. However, experiences lacking each of these candidate properties are conceivable--that is, conceiving of them does not lead to self-contradiction or absurdity. They are also achievable, as revealed by altered states of consciousness reached through dreaming, meditative practices, or drugs.\n\n### Postulates of physical existence\n\nTo account for the many regularities of experience (Box I), it is a good inference to assume the existence of a world that persists independently of one's experience (_realism_). From within consciousness, we can probe the physical existence of things outside of our experience, operationally--through observations and manipulations. To be granted physical existence, something should have the power to \"take a difference\" (be affected) and \"make a difference\" (produce effects) in a reliable way (_physicalism_). IIT also assumes \"operational reductionism,\" which means that, ideally, to establish what exists in physical terms, one would start from the smallest units that can take and make a difference, so that nothing is left out (_atomism_).\n\nBy characterizing physical existence operationally as cause-effect power, IIT can proceed to formulate the axioms of phenomenal existence as postulates of physical existence. Thisestablishes the requirements for the _substrate of consciousness_, where \"substrate\" is meant operationally as a set of units that can be observed and manipulated.\n\n**Existence**: The substrate of consciousness can be characterized operationally by _cause-effect power_: its units must _take and make a difference_.\n\nBuilding from this \"zeroth\" postulate, IIT formulates the five axioms in terms of postulates of physical existence that must be satisfied by the substrate of consciousness:\n\n**Intrinsicity**: Its cause-effect power must be _intrinsic_: it must take and make a difference _within itself_.\n**Information**: Its cause-effect power must be _specific_: it must be in _this state_ and select _this cause-effect state_.\n\nThis state is the one with maximal _intrinsic information_ (_ii_), a measure of the difference a system takes or makes over itself for a given cause state and effect state.\n**Integration**: Its cause-effect power must be _unitary_: it must specify its cause-effect state as _a whole set_ of units, irreducible to separate subsets of units.\n\nIrreducibility is measured by _integrated information_ (\\(\\varphi\\)) over the substrate's minimum partition.\n**Exclusion**: Its cause-effect power must be _definite_: it must specify its cause-effect state as _this whole set_ of units.\n\nThis is the set of units that is maximally irreducible, as measured by maximum \\(\\varphi\\) (\\(\\varphi^{*}\\)). This set is called a _maximal substrate_, also known as a _complex_[8, 13].\n**Composition**: Its cause-effect power must be _structured_: subsets of its units must specify cause-effect states over subsets of units (_distinctions_) that can overlap with one another (_relations_), yielding a _cause-effect structure_ or _\\(\\Phi\\)-structure_ (\"Phi-structure\") that is _the way it is_.\n\nDistinctions and relations, in turn, must also satisfy the postulates of physical existence: they must have cause-effect power, within the substrate of consciousness, in a specific, unitary, and definite way (they do not have components, being components themselves). They thus have an associated \\(\\varphi\\) value. The \\(\\Phi\\)-structure unfolded from a complex corresponds to the quality of consciousness. The sum total of the \\(\\varphi\\) values of the distinctions and relations that compose the \\(\\Phi\\)-structure measures its _structure integrated information_\\(\\Phi\\) (\"big phi,\" \"structure Phi\") and corresponds to the quantity of consciousness.\n\nAccording to IIT, the physical properties characterized by the postulates are necessary and sufficient for an entity to be conscious. They are necessary because they are needed to account for the properties of experience that are essential, in the sense that it is inconceivable for an experience to lack any one of them. They are also sufficient because no additional property of experience is essential, in the sense that it is conceivable for an experience to lack that property. Thus, no additional physical property is a necessary requirement for being a substrate of consciousness.\n\nThe postulates of IIT have been and are being applied to account for the location of the substrate of consciousness in the brain [4] and for its loss and recovery in physiological and pathological conditions [22, 23].\n\n### The explanatory identity between experiences and \\(\\Phi\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
