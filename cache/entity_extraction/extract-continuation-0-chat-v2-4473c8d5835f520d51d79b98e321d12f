IIT assumes that, in principle, it should be possible to account for everything purely in terms of cause-effect power--cause-effect power \"all the way down\" to conditional probabilities between atomic units (see (5) in S1 Notes). Eventually, this would leave neither room nor need to assume intrinsic properties or laws.\n\n### Intrinsic perspective\n\nWhen accounting for experience itself in physical terms, existence should be evaluated from the intrinsic perspective of an entity--what exists for the entity itself--not from the perspective of an external observer. This assumption is embedded in IIT's postulate of intrinsicality and has several consequences. One is that, from the intrinsic perspective, the quality and quantity of existence must be observer-independent and cannot be arbitrary. For instance, information in IIT must be relative to the specific state the entity is in, rather than an average of states as assessed by an external observer. Similarly, it should be evaluated based on the uniform distribution of possible states, as captured by the entity's TPM (1), rather than on an observed probability distribution. By the same token, units outside the entity should be treated as background conditions that do not contribute directly to what the system is. The intrinsic perspective also imposes a tension between expansion and dilution (see below and [12, 14]): from the intrinsic perspective of a system (or a mechanism within the system), having more units may increase its informativeness (cause-effect power measured as deviation from chance), while at the same time diluting its selectivity (ability to concentrate cause-effect power over a specific state).\n\n### Overview of IIT's framework\n\nIIT 4.0 aims at providing a formal framework to characterize the cause-effect structure of a substrate in a given state by expressing IIT's postulates in mathematical terms. In line with operational physicalism (Box1), we characterize a substrate by the transition probability function of its constituting units.\n\nOn this basis, the IIT formalism first identifies sets of units that fulfill all required properties of a substrate of consciousness according to the postulates of physical existence. First, for a candidate system, we determine a maximal cause-effect state based on the intrinsic information (ii) that the system in its current state specifies over its possible cause states and effect states. We then determine the maximal substrate based on the integrated information (\\(\\varphi_{s}\\), \"system phi\") of the maximal cause-effect state. To qualify as a substrate of consciousness, a candidate system must specify a maximum of integrated information (\\(\\varphi_{s}^{*}\\)) compared to all competing candidate systems with overlapping units.\n\nThe second part of the IIT formalism _unfolds_ the cause-effect structure specified by a maximal substrate in its current state, its \\(\\Phi\\)_-structure_. To that end, we determine the distinctions and relations specified by the substrate's subsets according to the postulates of physical existence. Distinctions are cause-effect states specified over subsets of substrate units (_purviews_) by subsets of substrate units (_mechanisms_). Relations are congruent overlaps among distinctions' cause and/or effect states. Distinctions and relations are also characterized by their integrated information (\\(\\varphi_{d},\\varphi_{r}\\)). The \\(\\Phi\\)-structure they compose corresponds to the quality of the experience specified by the substrate; the sum of their \\(\\varphi_{d\\mu}\\) values corresponds to its quantity (\\(\\Phi\\)).\n\nWhile IIT must still be considered as work in progress, having undergone successive refinements, IIT 4.0 is the first formulation of IIT that strives to characterize \\(\\Phi\\)-structures completely and to do so based on measures that satisfy the postulates uniquely. For a comparison of the updated framework with IIT 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0, see S2 Text.\n\n### Substrates, transition probabilities, and cause-effect power\n\nIIT takes physical existence as synonymous with having cause-effect power, the ability to take and make a difference. Consequently, a substrate \\(U\\) with state space \\(\\Omega_{U}\\) is operationally defined by its potential interactions, assessed in terms of conditional probabilities (physicalism, Box 1). We denote the complete transition probability function of a substrate \\(U\\) over a system update \\(u\\rightarrow\\bar{u}\\) as\n\n\\[\\mathcal{T}_{{}_{U}}\\equiv p(\\bar{u}\\mid u),\\quad u,\\bar{u}\\in\\Omega_{{}_{U}}. \\tag{1}\\]\n\nA substrate in IIT can be described as a stochastic system \\(U=\\{U_{1},U_{2}\\ldots,U_{n}\\}\\) of \\(n\\) interacting units with state space \\(\\Omega_{{}_{U}}=\\prod_{i}\\Omega_{{}_{U_{i}}}\\) and current state \\(u\\in\\Omega_{U}\\). We define units in state \\(u\\) as a set of tuples, where each tuple contains the unit and the state of the unit, _i.e._, \\(u=\\{(U_{i}\\,\\text{state}(U_{i})):U_{i}\\in U\\}\\). This allows us to define set operations over \\(u\\) that consider both the units and their states. \\(\\Omega_{{}_{U}}\\) is the set of all possible such tuple sets, corresponding to all the possible states of \\(U\\). We assume that the system updates in discrete steps, that the state space \\(\\Omega_{U}\\) is finite, and that the individual random variables \\(U_{i}\\in U\\) are conditionally independent from each other given the preceding state of \\(U\\):\n\n\\[p(\\bar{u}\\mid u)=\\prod_{i=1\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>\"IIT\"<|>\"organization\"<|>\"IIT, or Integrated Information Theory, aims to provide a formal framework to characterize the cause-effect structure of consciousness by expressing its postulates in mathematical terms, focusing on cause-effect power and the intrinsic perspective of entities.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Cause-Effect Power\"<|>\"concept\"<|>\"Cause-Effect Power is central to IIT's framework, defined as the ability of a system to take and make a difference, operationally assessed through conditional probabilities between atomic units.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Intrinsic Perspective\"<|>\"concept\"<|>\"Intrinsic Perspective in IIT refers to evaluating existence from the viewpoint of the entity itself, emphasizing observer-independent quality and quantity of existence.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Transition Probability Function\"<|>\"concept\"<|>\"Transition Probability Function is used in IIT to describe the potential interactions of a substrate, assessed in terms of conditional probabilities between its states.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Substrate\"<|>\"concept\"<|>\"A Substrate in IIT is described as a stochastic system of interacting units with a defined state space, crucial for determining the cause-effect structure of consciousness.\")##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"IIT\"<|>\"Cause-Effect Power\"<|>\"IIT uses the concept of Cause-Effect Power to define physical existence and the operational framework for consciousness.\"<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"IIT\"<|>\"Intrinsic Perspective\"<|>\"IIT embeds the Intrinsic Perspective in its postulate of intrinsicality, affecting how existence and information are evaluated.\"<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"IIT\"<|>\"Transition Probability Function\"<|>\"The Transition Probability Function is a fundamental concept in IIT for characterizing the interactions of a substrate.\"<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"IIT\"<|>\"Substrate\"<|>\"IIT characterizes consciousness by identifying substrates with maximum integrated information, using the concept of a Substrate.\"<|>10)<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
