{"result": "Exclusion, as defined within the framework of Integrated Information Theory (IIT), refers to the principle that consciousness is a definite and indivisible experience. It emphasizes that for consciousness to arise, it must be based on a specific set of units that together form a complete whole. This principle ensures that the substrate of consciousness is not arbitrary but is constituted of a definite set of units focused on maximizing integrated information. Thus, Exclusion underlines the necessity for a precise and integrated set of components to generate the unified experience of consciousness.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
