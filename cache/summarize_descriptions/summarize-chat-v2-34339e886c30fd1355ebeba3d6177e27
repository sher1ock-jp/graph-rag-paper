{"result": "Composition, as described by Integrated Information Theory (IIT), refers to the structured nature of experience, which is composed of distinctions and relations that give it a unique feel. It involves characterizing the cause-effect structure of a complex by considering all its subsets and unfolding its cause-effect power. This process highlights the importance of understanding how different components within a system interact and contribute to the system's overall behavior and experience.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
