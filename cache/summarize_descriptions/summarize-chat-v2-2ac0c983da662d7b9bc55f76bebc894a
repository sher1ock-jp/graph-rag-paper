{"result": "Integrated Information Theory (IIT) aims to provide a comprehensive explanation of consciousness, including its nature, presence, and the reasons it depends on certain brain regions, as well as its behavior during different states. IIT seeks to explain the substrate and properties of consciousness through its theoretical framework, offering a detailed account of what consciousness is and how it can be understood. It provides a framework for understanding consciousness by defining the essential properties and conditions necessary for a physical system to support experience. This theory endeavors to account for the complexities of consciousness, aiming to elucidate why specific brain regions are integral to conscious experience and how consciousness manifests in various states.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
