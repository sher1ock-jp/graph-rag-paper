This spectral entity first appears to Scrooge to warn him of the impending visitation by Three Spirits, setting the stage for Scrooge's transformative journey. Marley's Ghost, described as having a child-like yet old appearance, exults in the joy and mirth of Christmas, embodying the spirit of the season by spreading cheer and affecting those it encounters, including Scrooge.
