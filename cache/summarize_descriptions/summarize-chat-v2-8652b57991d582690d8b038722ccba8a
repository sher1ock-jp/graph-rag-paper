{"result": "In the realm of intrinsic ontology and Integrated Information Theory (IIT), the concept of \"INFORMATION\" is perceived through a unique lens that diverges significantly from classical interpretations, which primarily view information as a means for communication and storage. Within this context, \"INFORMATION\" is characterized by its causal nature, intrinsic value, specificity, maximal irreducibility, and structured form. This perspective is further elaborated by the postulate of Information, which asserts that the cause-effect power inherent in the substrate is distinguished by its specificity. This means that the substrate selects this cause-effect state because it embodies the maximal intrinsic information. This approach to understanding \"INFORMATION\" underscores the complexity and depth of information beyond its conventional roles, highlighting its fundamental importance in the structure and function of systems as per the principles of intrinsic ontology and IIT.", "input": "\nYou are an intelligent assistant tasked with synthesizing a detailed summary based on the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions associated with them, your goal is to create a single, coherent summary that integrates all the provided information.\nIf the descriptions contain conflicting information, carefully resolve these contradictions to ensure the summary is accurate and cohesive.\nEnsure the summary is written in third person, clearly mentioning the entity names to provide complete context.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"\\\"INFORMATION\\\"\"\nDescription List: [\"\\\"Information, in the context of intrinsic ontology and IIT, is considered as causal, intrinsic, specific, maximally irreducible, and structured, differing from classical accounts of information as merely communication and storage.\\\"\", \"\\\"The postulate of Information states that the cause-effect power of the substrate must be specific, selecting this cause-effect state with maximal intrinsic information.\\\"\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
