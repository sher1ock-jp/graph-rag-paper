{"result": "Integrated Information Theory (IIT) is a comprehensive framework designed to explain the presence, quality, and variations of consciousness in physical terms. It begins with the fundamental existence of experience and aims to characterize its essential properties, providing a unified view of nature and the study of consciousness. IIT discusses consciousness's causal powers and the evolution of these powers, emphasizing the importance of understanding consciousness through its axioms, postulates, and mathematical formalism. The theory has undergone significant evolution, from versions 1.0 to 4.0, each version incorporating advances and refining the framework to better account for consciousness. IIT proposes understanding consciousness through concepts of intrinsic information, integration, and exclusion. This approach seeks to explain the substrate of consciousness in the brain, including how it varies across physiological and pathological conditions, thereby offering a detailed framework for the study and understanding of consciousness in a coherent and unified manner.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
