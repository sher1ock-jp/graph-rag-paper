{"result": "Integrated Information Theory (IIT) is a theoretical framework that suggests consciousness emerges from the integration of information within a system. This theory posits that for consciousness to arise, the system must possess causal powers that are intrinsic, meaning they originate from within the system itself, specific, indicating that they are unique to the system, and structured, implying that the information is organized in a particular way. IIT emphasizes the importance of these characteristics in understanding how consciousness comes into being, highlighting the complex interplay of information integration within a system.", "input": "\nYou are an intelligent assistant tasked with synthesizing a detailed summary based on the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions associated with them, your goal is to create a single, coherent summary that integrates all the provided information.\nIf the descriptions contain conflicting information, carefully resolve these contradictions to ensure the summary is accurate and cohesive.\nEnsure the summary is written in third person, clearly mentioning the entity names to provide complete context.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"\\\"INTEGRATED INFORMATION THEORY (IIT)\\\"\"\nDescription List: [\"\", \"\\\"IIT proposes that consciousness arises from the integration of information within a system, characterized by causal powers that are intrinsic, specific, and structured.\\\"\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
