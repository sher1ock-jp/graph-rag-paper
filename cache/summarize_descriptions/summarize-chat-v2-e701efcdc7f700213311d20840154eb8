{"result": "A maximal substrate is identified within the universal substrate as a complex that exhibits the highest value of system integrated information (\\(\\varphi_{i}\\)), excluding any overlapping substrates with lower \\(\\varphi_{s}\\). This complex, or set of units, satisfies all of Integrated Information Theory's (IIT's) postulates, representing an intrinsic entity characterized by unfolded causal powers and distinctions. Essentially, a maximal substrate is a set of units for which integrated information is maximal, adhering to the principle of maximal existence. This concept underscores the importance of identifying such complexes as they embody the peak of integrated information, making them crucial for understanding the dynamics of consciousness and complex systems.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
