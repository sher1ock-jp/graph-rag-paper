{"result": "Integration is defined as the process of specifying the maximal cause-effect state of a system in a manner that is irreducible. This is assessed by partitioning the system into separate parts to understand its comprehensive nature. Furthermore, integration embodies the unitary nature of experience, which cannot be reduced to separate experiences. This concept underlines the holistic aspect of consciousness in Integrated Information Theory (IIT), highlighting the interconnectedness and indivisibility of systems and experiences.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
