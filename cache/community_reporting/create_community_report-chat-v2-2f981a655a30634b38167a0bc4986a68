Unlike the traditional view of information as a means for communication and storage, IIT posits information as having a causal nature, intrinsic value, and being maximally irreducible. This perspective emphasizes the complexity and depth of information, highlighting its fundamental importance in the structure and function of systems.

This principle is crucial for the emergence of consciousness, as it ensures that the system is more than the sum of its parts. The integration of information within a system allows for the emergence of a unified conscious experience, distinguishing conscious entities from those that are not. This concept underscores the importance of unity and irreducibility in the mechanisms that give rise to consciousness.

The theory's notion of information as causal, intrinsic, specific, and structured is complemented by the demand for integration, which specifies that the cause-effect power must be unitary. This relationship is key to understanding how consciousness can emerge from a substrate, as it requires both the complexity of information and its unified integration. The interplay between these concepts forms the backbone of IIT, offering insights into the nature of consciousness and its emergence.
