Initially characterized by his miserliness, isolation, and a practical, skeptical approach to life, Scrooge's attitude towards Christmas, relationships, and humanity at large undergoes a profound transformation following a series of supernatural visitations. These visitations are from various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and other spectral figures, who guide him through a journey of self-reflection and moral awakening.\n\nThroughout this journey, Scrooge is confronted with different aspects of his life, humanity, and the consequences of his actions. He reflects on his past Christmas experiences with both joy and sorrow, particularly during interactions with the Ghost and his own younger self. He witnesses scenes of Christmas cheer, the aftermath of a man's death, and the impact of his own choices on others, including his clerk Bob Cratchit and Cratchit's family. This leads to a moment of realization and a plea for change, as Scrooge fears the world's reproach and sees his nobler aspirations fall off for the pursuit of gain.\n\nDespite his initial reluctance and fear, Scrooge shows curiosity, skepticism, and eventually, a willingness to learn and change. He undergoes a significant transformation, expressing regret for his past actions and a strong desire to change his future. This change is marked by deep emotional responses to the visions shown by the spirits and a newfound understanding of the importance of compassion, generosity, and the Christmas spirit.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Scrooge's transformation becomes evident through his actions. He decides to buy a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engages positively with people on the streets, showing a change in mood and behavior. His transformation is central to the narrative, indirectly affecting the lives of those around him, including the Cratchit family and his nephew.\n\nScrooge's journey from a stingy, hard, and unfeeling man to a better friend, master, and man known for keeping Christmas well illustrates the potential for change and redemption.
