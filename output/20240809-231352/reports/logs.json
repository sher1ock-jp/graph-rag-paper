For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\nappearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.\n\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being\nacquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time of\nday, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing\nthat they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter;\nbetween which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide\nand comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite\nas hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you to believe that he was\nready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing\nbetween a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\n\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means\nprepared for nothing; and consequently, when the bell struck One, and no\nshape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five\nminutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.\nAll this time he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze\nof ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\nhour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen\nghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at;\nand was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an\ninteresting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the\nconsolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you\nor I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the\npredicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would\nunquestionably have done it too--at last, I say, he began to think that\nthe source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining\nroom, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea\ntaking full possession of his mind, he got up softly, and shuffled in\nhis slippers to the door.\n\nThe moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by\nhis name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.\n\nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone\na surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with\nliving green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which\nbright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe,\nand ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been\nscattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as\nthat dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time,\nor Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the\nfloor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry,\nbrawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,\nmince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,\ncherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense\ntwelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim\nwith their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch there sat a\njolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not\nunlike Plenty's horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on\nScrooge as he came peeping round the door.\n\n'Come in!' exclaimed the Ghost. 'Come in! and know me better, man!'\n\nScrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was\nnot the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit's eyes were\nclear and kind, he did not like to meet them.\n\n'I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,' said the Spirit. 'Look upon me!'\n\nScrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple deep green robe,\nor mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the\nfigure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be\nwarded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the\nample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no\nother covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining\nicicles. Its dark-brown curls were long and free; free as its genial\nface, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its\nunconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was\nan antique scabbard: but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was\neaten up with rust.\n\n'You have never seen the like of me before!' exclaimed the Spirit.\n\n'Never,' Scrooge made answer to it.\n\n'Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning\n(for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?'\npursued the Phantom.\n\n'I don't think I have,' said Scrooge. 'I am afraid I have not. Have\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Here, again, were shadows on the window-blinds of\nguests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and\nfur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near\nneighbour's house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them\nenter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!\n\nBut, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to\nfriendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to\ngive them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting\ncompany, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how\nthe Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its\ncapacious palm, and floated on, outpouring with a generous hand its\nbright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very\nlamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of\nlight, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out\nloudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that\nhe had any company but Christmas.\n\nAnd now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a\nbleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast\nabout, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread\nitself wheresoever it listed; or would have done so, but for the frost\nthat held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse,\nrank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery\nred, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye,\nand frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of\ndarkest night.\n\n'What place is this?' asked Scrooge.\n\n'A place where miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,'\nreturned the Spirit. 'But they know me. See!'\n\nA light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced\ntowards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a\ncheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and\nwoman, with their children and their children's children, and another\ngeneration beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.\nThe old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind\nupon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song; it had been a\nvery old song when he was a boy; and from time to time they all joined\nin the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got\nquite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank\nagain.\n\nThe Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and,\npassing on above the moor, sped whither? Not to sea? To sea. To\nScrooge's horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful\nrange of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the\nthundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the\ndreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\n\nBuilt upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore,\non which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there\nstood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of seaweed clung to its base,\nand storm-birds--born of the wind, one might suppose, as seaweed of the\nwater--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\n\nBut, even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that\nthrough the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of\nbrightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough\ntable at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their\ncan of grog; and one of them--the elder too, with his face all damaged\nand scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might\nbe--struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself.\n\nAgain the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea--on, on--until\nbeing far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a\nship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the\nbow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their\nseveral stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or\nhad a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of\nsome bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And\nevery man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder\nword for one another on that day than on any day in the year; and had\nshared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he\ncared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember\nhim.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Bless his heart, it's Fezziwig alive again!'\n\nOld Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which\npointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his\ncapacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his\norgan of benevolence; and called out, in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat,\njovial voice--\n\n'Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!'\n\nScrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in,\naccompanied by his fellow-'prentice.\n\n'Dick Wilkins, to be sure!' said Scrooge to the Ghost.

They charged into\nthe street with the shutters--one, two, three--had 'em up in their\nplaces--four, five, six--barred 'em and pinned 'em--seven, eight,\nnine--and came back before you could have got to twelve, panting like\nracehorses.\n\n'Hilli-ho!' cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk with\nwonderful agility. 'Clear away, my lads, and let's have lots of room\nhere! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup, Ebenezer!'\n\nClear away! There was nothing they wouldn't have cleared away, or\ncouldn't have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on. It was done in\na minute. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from\npublic life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps\nwere trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as\nsnug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room as you would desire to\nsee upon a winter's night.\n\nIn came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and\nmade an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. In came\nMrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three Miss\nFezziwigs, beaming and lovable. In came the six young followers whose\nhearts they broke. In came all the young men and women employed in the\nbusiness. In came the housemaid, with her cousin the baker. In came the\ncook with her brother's particular friend the milkman. In came the boy\nfrom over the way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his\nmaster; trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one,\nwho was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress. In they all\ncame, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some\nawkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, any how and\nevery how. Away they all went, twenty couple at once; hands half round\nand back again the other way; down the middle and up again; round and\nround in various stages of affectionate grouping; old top couple always\nturning up in the wrong place; new top couple starting off again as soon\nas they got there; all top couples at last, and not a bottom one to help\nthem! When this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his\nhands to stop the dance, cried out, 'Well done!' and the fiddler plunged\nhis hot face into a pot of porter, especially provided for that purpose.\nBut, scorning rest upon his reappearance, he instantly began again,\nthough there were no dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been\ncarried home, exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man\nresolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.\n\n[Illustration: _Then old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs.\nFezziwig_]\n\nThere were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and\nthere was cake, and there was negus, and there was a great piece of Cold\nRoast, and there was a great piece of Cold Boiled, and there were\nmince-pies, and plenty of beer. But the great effect of the evening came\nafter the Roast and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The\nsort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have told\nit him!) struck up 'Sir Roger de Coverley.' Then old Fezziwig stood\nout to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top couple, too; with a good stiff\npiece of work cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair of\npartners; people who were not to be trifled with; people who would\ndance, and had no notion of walking.\n\nBut if they had been twice as many--ah!\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Mrs.\nCratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing\nhot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss\nBelinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob\ntook Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young\nCratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and,\nmounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest\nthey should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At\nlast the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a\nbreathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the\ncarving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did,\nand when the long-expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of\ndelight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two\nyoung Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife and\nfeebly cried Hurrah!\n\n[Illustration: HE HAD BEEN TIM'S BLOOD-HORSE ALL THE WAY FROM CHURCH]\n\nThere never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe there ever was\nsuch a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness,\nwere the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple sauce and\nmashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family;\nindeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small\natom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at last! Yet every\none had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits, in particular, were\nsteeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being\nchanged by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous\nto bear witnesses--to take the pudding up, and bring it in.\n\nSuppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning\nout! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard and\nstolen it, while they were merry with the goose--a supposition at which\nthe two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were\nsupposed.\n\nHallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell\nlike a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and\na pastry-cook's next door to each other, with a laundress's next door to\nthat! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit\nentered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding, like a speckled\ncannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of\nignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.\n\nOh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he\nregarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since\ntheir marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that, now the weight was off her\nmind, she would confess she had her doubts about the quantity of flour.\nEverybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it\nwas at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat\nheresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a\nthing.\n\n[Illustration: WITH THE PUDDING]\n\nAt last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth\nswept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted and\nconsidered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a\nshovel full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family\ndrew round the hearth in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half\na one; and at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass.\nTwo tumblers and a custard cup without a handle.\n\nThese held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden\ngoblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while\nthe chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob\nproposed:\n\n'A merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!'\n\nWhich all the family re-echoed.\n\n'God bless us every one!' said Tiny Tim, the last of all.\n\nHe sat very close to his father's side, upon his little stool. Bob held\nhis withered little hand to his, as if he loved the child, and wished to\nkeep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.\n\n'Spirit,' said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, 'tell\nme if Tiny Tim will live.'\n\n'I see a vacant seat,' replied the Ghost, 'in the poor chimney corner,\nand a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows\nremain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.'\n\n'No, no,' said Scrooge. 'Oh no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.'\n\n'If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future none other of my race,'\nreturned the Ghost, '\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The panels shrunk, the windows cracked;\nfragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were\nshown instead; but how all this was brought about Scrooge knew no more\nthan you do.

Then the shouting and the struggling, and the\nonslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him, with\nchairs for ladders, to dive into his pockets, despoil him of\nbrown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his\nneck, pummel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The\nshouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package\nwas received! The terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in\nthe act of putting a doll's frying pan into his mouth, and was more than\nsuspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden\nplatter!

Tut, don't I know?' she added in the same breath, laughing\nas he laughed. 'Mr. Scrooge.'\n\n'Mr. Scrooge it was.

'That they are what they are do not blame me!'\n\n'Remove me!' Scrooge exclaimed, 'I cannot bear it!'\n\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a\nface, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces\nit had shown him, wrestled with it.\n\n'Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!'\n\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost\nwith no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort\nof its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and\nbright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized\nthe extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its\nhead.\n\n[Illustration: _Laden with Christmas toys and presents_]\n\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its\nwhole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he\ncould not hide the light, which streamed from under it, in an unbroken\nflood upon the ground.\n\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible\ndrowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom.

He felt that he was\nrestored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial\npurpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to\nhim through Jacob Marley's intervention. But finding that he turned\nuncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this\nnew spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own\nhands, and, lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the\nbed.

Is it a foot or a\nclaw?'\n\n'It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,' was the Spirit's\nsorrowful reply. 'Look here!'\n\nFrom the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject,\nfrightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung\nupon the outside of its garment.\n\n'O Man! look here! Look, look down here!' exclaimed the Ghost.\n\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but\nprostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\nfilled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a\nstale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted\nthem, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat\nenthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no\ndegradation, no perversion of humanity in any grade, through all the\nmysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and\ndread.\n\nScrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he\ntried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves,\nrather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\n\n'Spirit! are they yours?' Scrooge could say no more.\n\n'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they\ncling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This\ngirl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of\nall beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,\nunless the writing be erased. Deny it!' cried the Spirit, stretching out\nhis hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for\nyour factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!'\n\n'Have they no refuge or resource?' cried Scrooge.\n\n'Are there no prisons?' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last\ntime with his own words. 'Are there no workhouses?'\n\nThe bell struck Twelve.\n\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last\nstroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob\nMarley, and, lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and\nhooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.\n\n\nSTAVE FOUR\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST OF THE SPIRITS\n\n\nThe Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near him,\nScrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this\nSpirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\n\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched\nhand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\nsurrounded.\n\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n\n'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said\nScrooge.\n\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n\n'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\nbut will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,\nSpirit?'\n\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\nhe received.\n\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\nrecover.\n\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,\nuncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\nheap of black.\n\n'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre\nI have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope\nto live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your\ncompany, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?'\n\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n\n'Lead on!' said Scrooge. 'Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is\nprecious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!'\n\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in\nthe shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him\nalong.\n\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to\nspring up about them, and encompass them of its own act.

Think\nof that! Bob had but fifteen 'Bob' a week himself; he pocketed on\nSaturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of\nChristmas Present blessed his four-roomed house!\n\nThen up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed out but poorly in a\ntwice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap, and make a\ngoodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda\nCratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master\nPeter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and getting\nthe corners of his monstrous shirt-collar (Bob's private property,\nconferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day,) into his mouth,\nrejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to show his\nlinen in the fashionable Parks. And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and\ngirl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker's they had smelt\nthe goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious thoughts\nof sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about the table, and\nexalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he (not proud,\nalthough his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the slow\npotatoes, bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out\nand peeled.\n\n'What has ever got your precious father, then?' said Mrs. Cratchit. 'And\nyour brother, Tiny Tim? And Martha warn't as late last Christmas Day by\nhalf an hour!'\n\n'Here's Martha, mother!' said a girl, appearing as she spoke.\n\n'Here's Martha, mother!' cried the two young Cratchits. 'Hurrah! There's\n_such_ a goose, Martha!'\n\n'Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!' said Mrs.\nCratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet\nfor her with officious zeal.\n\n'We'd a deal of work to finish up last night,' replied the girl, 'and\nhad to clear away this morning, mother!'\n\n'Well! never mind so long as you are come,' said Mrs. Cratchit.

Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a\nlittle crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame!\n\n'Why, where's our Martha?' cried Bob Cratchit, looking round.\n\n'Not coming,' said Mrs. Cratchit.\n\n'Not coming!' said Bob, with a sudden declension in his high spirits;\nfor he had been Tim's blood-horse all the way from church, and had come\nhome rampant. 'Not coming upon Christmas Day!'\n\nMartha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only in joke; so\nshe came out prematurely from behind the closet door, and ran into his\narms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off\ninto the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in the\ncopper.\n\n'And how did little Tim behave?' asked Mrs. Cratchit when she had\nrallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to his\nheart's content.\n\n'As good as gold,' said Bob, 'and better.

He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the\nchurch, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to\nremember upon Christmas Day who made lame beggars walk and blind men\nsee.'\n\nBob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when\nhe said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty.\n\nHis active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny\nTim before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and\nsister to his stool beside the fire; and while Bob, turning up his\ncuffs--as if, poor fellow, they were capable of being made more\nshabby--compounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and\nstirred it round and round, and put it on the hob to simmer, Master\nPeter and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose,\nwith which they soon returned in high procession.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nSuch a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of\nall birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of\ncourse--and, in truth, it was something very like it in that house. Mrs.\nCratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing\nhot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss\nBelinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dust\n######################\nOutput:"}}

INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\ntrademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\nproviding copies of Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works in\naccordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the\nproduction, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg\u2122\nelectronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,\nincluding legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of\nthe following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this\nor any Project Gutenberg\u2122 work, (b) alteration, modification, or\nadditions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg\u2122 work, and (c) any\nDefect you cause.\n\nSection 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

If these shadows\nremain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.'\n\n'No, no,' said Scrooge. 'Oh no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.'\n\n'If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future none other of my race,'\nreturned the Ghost, 'will find him here. What then? If he be like to\ndie, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.'\n\nScrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit, and\nwas overcome with penitence and grief.\n\n'Man,' said the Ghost, 'if man you be in heart, not adamant, forbear\nthat wicked cant until you have discovered what the surplus is, and\nwhere it is. Will you decide what men shall live, what men shall die? It\nmay be that, in the sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit\nto live than millions like this poor man's child. O God! to hear the\ninsect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry\nbrothers in the dust!'\n\nScrooge bent before the Ghost's rebuke, and, trembling, cast his eyes\nupon the ground. But he raised them speedily on hearing his own name.\n\n'Mr. Scrooge!' said Bob. 'I'll give you Mr. Scrooge, the Founder of the\nFeast!'\n\n'The Founder of the Feast, indeed!' cried Mrs. Cratchit, reddening. 'I\nwish I had him here. I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast upon, and\nI hope he'd have a good appetite for it.'\n\n'My dear,' said Bob, 'the children! Christmas Day.'\n\n'It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,' said she, 'on which one drinks\nthe health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as Mr.\nScrooge. You know he is, Robert! Nobody knows it better than you do,\npoor fellow!'\n\n'My dear!' was Bob's mild answer. 'Christmas Day.'\n\n'I'll drink his health for your sake and the Day's,' said Mrs. Cratchit,\n'not for his. Long life to him! A merry Christmas and a happy New Year!\nHe'll be very merry and very happy, I have no doubt!'\n\nThe children drank the toast after her. It was the first of their\nproceedings which had no heartiness in it. Tiny Tim drank it last of\nall, but he didn't care twopence for it. Scrooge was the Ogre of the\nfamily. The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party, which\nwas not dispelled for full five minutes.\n\nAfter it had passed away they were ten times merrier than before, from\nthe mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with. Bob Cratchit\ntold them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which\nwould bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly. The two\nyoung Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter's being a man\nof business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from\nbetween his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular\ninvestments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that\nbewildering income. Martha, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner's,\nthen told them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she\nworked at a stretch and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for\na good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home. Also how\nshe had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord\n'was much about as tall as Peter'; at which Peter pulled up his collar\nso high that you couldn't have seen his head if you had been there. All\nthis time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and by-and-by\nthey had a song, about a lost child travelling in the snow, from Tiny\nTim, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed.\n\nThere was nothing of high mark in this. They were not a handsome family;\nthey were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being waterproof;\ntheir clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely\ndid, the inside of a pawnbroker's. But they were happy, grateful,\npleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they\nfaded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit's\ntorch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny\nTim, until the last.\n\nBy this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as\nScrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the\nroaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms was\nwonderful. Here, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a\ncosy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the fire,\nand deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.\nThere, all the children of the house were running out into the snow to\nmeet their married sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the\nfirst to greet them.

Mrs.\nCratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing\nhot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss\nBelinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob\ntook Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young\nCratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and,\nmounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest\nthey should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At\nlast the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a\nbreathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the\ncarving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did,\nand when the long-expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of\ndelight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two\nyoung Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife and\nfeebly cried Hurrah!\n\n[Illustration: HE HAD BEEN TIM'S BLOOD-HORSE ALL THE WAY FROM CHURCH]\n\nThere never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe there ever was\nsuch a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness,\nwere the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple sauce and\nmashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family;\nindeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small\natom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at last! Yet every\none had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits, in particular, were\nsteeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being\nchanged by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous\nto bear witnesses--to take the pudding up, and bring it in.\n\nSuppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning\nout! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard and\nstolen it, while they were merry with the goose--a supposition at which\nthe two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were\nsupposed.\n\nHallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell\nlike a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and\na pastry-cook's next door to each other, with a laundress's next door to\nthat! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit\nentered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding, like a speckled\ncannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of\nignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.\n\nOh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he\nregarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since\ntheir marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that, now the weight was off her\nmind, she would confess she had her doubts about the quantity of flour.\nEverybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it\nwas at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat\nheresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a\nthing.\n\n[Illustration: WITH THE PUDDING]\n\nAt last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth\nswept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted and\nconsidered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a\nshovel full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family\ndrew round the hearth in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half\na one; and at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass.\nTwo tumblers and a custard cup without a handle.\n\nThese held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden\ngoblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while\nthe chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob\nproposed:\n\n'A merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!'\n\nWhich all the family re-echoed.\n\n'God bless us every one!' said Tiny Tim, the last of all.\n\nHe sat very close to his father's side, upon his little stool. Bob held\nhis withered little hand to his, as if he loved the child, and wished to\nkeep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.\n\n'Spirit,' said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, 'tell\nme if Tiny Tim will live.'\n\n'I see a vacant seat,' replied the Ghost, 'in the poor chimney corner,\nand a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows\nremain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.'\n\n'No, no,' said Scrooge. 'Oh no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.'\n\n'If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future none other of my race,'\nreturned the Ghost, '\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Here, again, were shadows on the window-blinds of\nguests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and\nfur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near\nneighbour's house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them\nenter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!\n\nBut, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to\nfriendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to\ngive them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting\ncompany, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how\nthe Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its\ncapacious palm, and floated on, outpouring with a generous hand its\nbright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very\nlamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of\nlight, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out\nloudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that\nhe had any company but Christmas.\n\nAnd now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a\nbleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast\nabout, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread\nitself wheresoever it listed; or would have done so, but for the frost\nthat held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse,\nrank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery\nred, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye,\nand frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of\ndarkest night.\n\n'What place is this?' asked Scrooge.\n\n'A place where miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,'\nreturned the Spirit. 'But they know me. See!'\n\nA light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced\ntowards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a\ncheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and\nwoman, with their children and their children's children, and another\ngeneration beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.\nThe old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind\nupon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song; it had been a\nvery old song when he was a boy; and from time to time they all joined\nin the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got\nquite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank\nagain.\n\nThe Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and,\npassing on above the moor, sped whither? Not to sea? To sea. To\nScrooge's horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful\nrange of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the\nthundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the\ndreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\n\nBuilt upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore,\non which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there\nstood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of seaweed clung to its base,\nand storm-birds--born of the wind, one might suppose, as seaweed of the\nwater--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\n\nBut, even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that\nthrough the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of\nbrightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough\ntable at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their\ncan of grog; and one of them--the elder too, with his face all damaged\nand scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might\nbe--struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself.\n\nAgain the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea--on, on--until\nbeing far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a\nship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the\nbow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their\nseveral stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or\nhad a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of\nsome bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And\nevery man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder\nword for one another on that day than on any day in the year; and had\nshared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he\ncared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember\nhim.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until\nthe master passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?'\n\n'What then?' he retorted. 'Even if I have grown so much wiser, what\nthen?

The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but\nno one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed\nheartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to\nmingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most\nruthlessly.

Think\nof that! Bob had but fifteen 'Bob' a week himself; he pocketed on\nSaturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of\nChristmas Present blessed his four-roomed house!\n\nThen up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed out but poorly in a\ntwice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap, and make a\ngoodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda\nCratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master\nPeter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and getting\nthe corners of his monstrous shirt-collar (Bob's private property,\nconferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day,) into his mouth,\nrejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to show his\nlinen in the fashionable Parks. And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and\ngirl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker's they had smelt\nthe goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious thoughts\nof sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about the table, and\nexalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he (not proud,\nalthough his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the slow\npotatoes, bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out\nand peeled.\n\n'What has ever got your precious father, then?' said Mrs. Cratchit. 'And\nyour brother, Tiny Tim? And Martha warn't as late last Christmas Day by\nhalf an hour!'\n\n'Here's Martha, mother!' said a girl, appearing as she spoke.\n\n'Here's Martha, mother!' cried the two young Cratchits. 'Hurrah! There's\n_such_ a goose, Martha!'\n\n'Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!' said Mrs.\nCratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet\nfor her with officious zeal.\n\n'We'd a deal of work to finish up last night,' replied the girl, 'and\nhad to clear away this morning, mother!'\n\n'Well! never mind so long as you are come,' said Mrs. Cratchit. 'Sit ye\ndown before the fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless ye!'\n\n'No, no! There's father coming,' cried the two young Cratchits, who were\neverywhere at once. 'Hide, Martha, hide!'\n\nSo Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father, with at least\nthree feet of comforter, exclusive of the fringe, hanging down before\nhim, and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed to look\nseasonable, and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a\nlittle crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame!\n\n'Why, where's our Martha?' cried Bob Cratchit, looking round.\n\n'Not coming,' said Mrs. Cratchit.\n\n'Not coming!' said Bob, with a sudden declension in his high spirits;\nfor he had been Tim's blood-horse all the way from church, and had come\nhome rampant. 'Not coming upon Christmas Day!'\n\nMartha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only in joke; so\nshe came out prematurely from behind the closet door, and ran into his\narms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off\ninto the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in the\ncopper.\n\n'And how did little Tim behave?' asked Mrs. Cratchit when she had\nrallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to his\nheart's content.\n\n'As good as gold,' said Bob, 'and better. Somehow, he gets thoughtful,\nsitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever\nheard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the\nchurch, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to\nremember upon Christmas Day who made lame beggars walk and blind men\nsee.'\n\nBob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when\nhe said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty.\n\nHis active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny\nTim before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and\nsister to his stool beside the fire; and while Bob, turning up his\ncuffs--as if, poor fellow, they were capable of being made more\nshabby--compounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and\nstirred it round and round, and put it on the hob to simmer, Master\nPeter and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose,\nwith which they soon returned in high procession.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nSuch a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of\nall birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of\ncourse--and, in truth, it was something very like it in that house. Mrs.\nCratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing\nhot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss\nBelinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dust\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The panels shrunk, the windows cracked;\nfragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were\nshown instead; but how all this was brought about Scrooge knew no more\nthan you do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything had\nhappened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had\ngone home for the jolly holidays.\n\nHe was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly.

For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\nappearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.\n\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being\nacquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time of\nday, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing\nthat they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter;\nbetween which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide\nand comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite\nas hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you to believe that he was\nready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing\nbetween a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\n\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means\nprepared for nothing; and consequently, when the bell struck One, and no\nshape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five\nminutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.\nAll this time he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze\nof ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\nhour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen\nghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at;\nand was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an\ninteresting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the\nconsolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you\nor I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the\npredicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would\nunquestionably have done it too--at last, I say, he began to think that\nthe source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining\nroom, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea\ntaking full possession of his mind, he got up softly, and shuffled in\nhis slippers to the door.\n\nThe moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by\nhis name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.\n\nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone\na surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with\nliving green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which\nbright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe,\nand ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been\nscattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as\nthat dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time,\nor Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the\nfloor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry,\nbrawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,\nmince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,\ncherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense\ntwelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim\nwith their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch there sat a\njolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not\nunlike Plenty's horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on\nScrooge as he came peeping round the door.\n\n'Come in!' exclaimed the Ghost. 'Come in! and know me better, man!'\n\nScrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was\nnot the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit's eyes were\nclear and kind, he did not like to meet them.\n\n'I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,' said the Spirit. 'Look upon me!'\n\nScrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple deep green robe,\nor mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the\nfigure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be\nwarded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the\nample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no\nother covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining\nicicles. Its dark-brown curls were long and free; free as its genial\nface, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its\nunconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was\nan antique scabbard: but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was\neaten up with rust.\n\n'You have never seen the like of me before!' exclaimed the Spirit.\n\n'Never,' Scrooge made answer to it.\n\n'Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning\n(for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?'\npursued the Phantom.\n\n'I don't think I have,' said Scrooge.

If these shadows\nremain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.'\n\n'No, no,' said Scrooge. 'Oh no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.'\n\n'If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future none other of my race,'\nreturned the Ghost, 'will find him here. What then? If he be like to\ndie, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.'\n\nScrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit, and\nwas overcome with penitence and grief.\n\n'Man,' said the Ghost, 'if man you be in heart, not adamant, forbear\nthat wicked cant until you have discovered what the surplus is, and\nwhere it is. Will you decide what men shall live, what men shall die? It\nmay be that, in the sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit\nto live than millions like this poor man's child. O God! to hear the\ninsect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry\nbrothers in the dust!'\n\nScrooge bent before the Ghost's rebuke, and, trembling, cast his eyes\nupon the ground. But he raised them speedily on hearing his own name.\n\n'Mr. Scrooge!' said Bob. 'I'll give you Mr. Scrooge, the Founder of the\nFeast!'\n\n'The Founder of the Feast, indeed!' cried Mrs. Cratchit, reddening. 'I\nwish I had him here. I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast upon, and\nI hope he'd have a good appetite for it.'\n\n'My dear,' said Bob, 'the children! Christmas Day.'\n\n'It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,' said she, 'on which one drinks\nthe health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as Mr.\nScrooge. You know he is, Robert! Nobody knows it better than you do,\npoor fellow!'\n\n'My dear!' was Bob's mild answer. 'Christmas Day.'\n\n'I'll drink his health for your sake and the Day's,' said Mrs. Cratchit,\n'not for his. Long life to him! A merry Christmas and a happy New Year!\nHe'll be very merry and very happy, I have no doubt!'\n\nThe children drank the toast after her. It was the first of their\nproceedings which had no heartiness in it. Tiny Tim drank it last of\nall, but he didn't care twopence for it. Scrooge was the Ogre of the\nfamily. The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party, which\nwas not dispelled for full five minutes.\n\nAfter it had passed away they were ten times merrier than before, from\nthe mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with. Bob Cratchit\ntold them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which\nwould bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly. The two\nyoung Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter's being a man\nof business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from\nbetween his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular\ninvestments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that\nbewildering income. Martha, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner's,\nthen told them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she\nworked at a stretch and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for\na good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home. Also how\nshe had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord\n'was much about as tall as Peter'; at which Peter pulled up his collar\nso high that you couldn't have seen his head if you had been there. All\nthis time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and by-and-by\nthey had a song, about a lost child travelling in the snow, from Tiny\nTim, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed.\n\nThere was nothing of high mark in this. They were not a handsome family;\nthey were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being waterproof;\ntheir clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely\ndid, the inside of a pawnbroker's. But they were happy, grateful,\npleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they\nfaded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit's\ntorch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny\nTim, until the last.\n\nBy this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as\nScrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the\nroaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms was\nwonderful. Here, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a\ncosy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the fire,\nand deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.\nThere, all the children of the house were running out into the snow to\nmeet their married sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the\nfirst to greet them.

Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Is it a foot or a\nclaw?'\n\n'It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,' was the Spirit's\nsorrowful reply. 'Look here!'\n\nFrom the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject,\nfrightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung\nupon the outside of its garment.\n\n'O Man! look here! Look, look down here!' exclaimed the Ghost.\n\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but\nprostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\nfilled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a\nstale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted\nthem, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat\nenthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no\ndegradation, no perversion of humanity in any grade, through all the\nmysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and\ndread.\n\nScrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he\ntried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves,\nrather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\n\n'Spirit! are they yours?' Scrooge could say no more.\n\n'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they\ncling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This\ngirl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of\nall beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,\nunless the writing be erased. Deny it!' cried the Spirit, stretching out\nhis hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for\nyour factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!'\n\n'Have they no refuge or resource?' cried Scrooge.\n\n'Are there no prisons?' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last\ntime with his own words. 'Are there no workhouses?'\n\nThe bell struck Twelve.\n\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last\nstroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob\nMarley, and, lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and\nhooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.\n\n\nSTAVE FOUR\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST OF THE SPIRITS\n\n\nThe Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near him,\nScrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this\nSpirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\n\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched\nhand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\nsurrounded.\n\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n\n'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said\nScrooge.\n\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n\n'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\nbut will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,\nSpirit?'\n\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\nhe received.\n\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\nrecover.\n\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,\nuncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\nheap of black.\n\n'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre\nI have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope\nto live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your\ncompany, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?'\n\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n\n'Lead on!' said Scrooge. 'Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is\nprecious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!'\n\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in\nthe shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him\nalong.\n\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to\nspring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there they\nwere in the heart of it; on 'Change, amongst the merchants,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Here, again, were shadows on the window-blinds of\nguests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and\nfur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near\nneighbour's house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them\nenter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!\n\nBut, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to\nfriendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to\ngive them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting\ncompany, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how\nthe Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its\ncapacious palm, and floated on, outpouring with a generous hand its\nbright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very\nlamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of\nlight, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out\nloudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that\nhe had any company but Christmas.\n\nAnd now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a\nbleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast\nabout, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread\nitself wheresoever it listed; or would have done so, but for the frost\nthat held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse,\nrank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery\nred, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye,\nand frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of\ndarkest night.\n\n'What place is this?' asked Scrooge.\n\n'A place where miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,'\nreturned the Spirit. 'But they know me. See!'\n\nA light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced\ntowards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a\ncheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and\nwoman, with their children and their children's children, and another\ngeneration beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.\nThe old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind\nupon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song; it had been a\nvery old song when he was a boy; and from time to time they all joined\nin the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got\nquite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank\nagain.\n\nThe Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and,\npassing on above the moor, sped whither? Not to sea? To sea. To\nScrooge's horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful\nrange of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the\nthundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the\ndreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\n\nBuilt upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore,\non which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there\nstood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of seaweed clung to its base,\nand storm-birds--born of the wind, one might suppose, as seaweed of the\nwater--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\n\nBut, even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that\nthrough the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of\nbrightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough\ntable at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their\ncan of grog; and one of them--the elder too, with his face all damaged\nand scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might\nbe--struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself.\n\nAgain the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea--on, on--until\nbeing far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a\nship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the\nbow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their\nseveral stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or\nhad a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of\nsome bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And\nevery man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder\nword for one another on that day than on any day in the year; and had\nshared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he\ncared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember\nhim.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Think\nof that! Bob had but fifteen 'Bob' a week himself; he pocketed on\nSaturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of\nChristmas Present blessed his four-roomed house!\n\nThen up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed out but poorly in a\ntwice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap, and make a\ngoodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda\nCratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master\nPeter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and getting\nthe corners of his monstrous shirt-collar (Bob's private property,\nconferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day,) into his mouth,\nrejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to show his\nlinen in the fashionable Parks. And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and\ngirl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker's they had smelt\nthe goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious thoughts\nof sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about the table, and\nexalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he (not proud,\nalthough his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the slow\npotatoes, bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out\nand peeled.\n\n'What has ever got your precious father, then?' said Mrs. Cratchit. 'And\nyour brother, Tiny Tim? And Martha warn't as late last Christmas Day by\nhalf an hour!'\n\n'Here's Martha, mother!' said a girl, appearing as she spoke.\n\n'Here's Martha, mother!' cried the two young Cratchits. 'Hurrah! There's\n_such_ a goose, Martha!'\n\n'Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!' said Mrs.\nCratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet\nfor her with officious zeal.\n\n'We'd a deal of work to finish up last night,' replied the girl, 'and\nhad to clear away this morning, mother!'\n\n'Well! never mind so long as you are come,' said Mrs. Cratchit. 'Sit ye\ndown before the fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless ye!'\n\n'No, no! There's father coming,' cried the two young Cratchits, who were\neverywhere at once. 'Hide, Martha, hide!'\n\nSo Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father, with at least\nthree feet of comforter, exclusive of the fringe, hanging down before\nhim, and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed to look\nseasonable, and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a\nlittle crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame!\n\n'Why, where's our Martha?' cried Bob Cratchit, looking round.\n\n'Not coming,' said Mrs. Cratchit.\n\n'Not coming!' said Bob, with a sudden declension in his high spirits;\nfor he had been Tim's blood-horse all the way from church, and had come\nhome rampant. 'Not coming upon Christmas Day!'\n\nMartha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only in joke; so\nshe came out prematurely from behind the closet door, and ran into his\narms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off\ninto the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in the\ncopper.\n\n'And how did little Tim behave?' asked Mrs. Cratchit when she had\nrallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to his\nheart's content.\n\n'As good as gold,' said Bob, 'and better.

He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the\nchurch, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to\nremember upon Christmas Day who made lame beggars walk and blind men\nsee.'\n\nBob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when\nhe said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty.\n\nHis active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny\nTim before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and\nsister to his stool beside the fire; and while Bob, turning up his\ncuffs--as if, poor fellow, they were capable of being made more\nshabby--compounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and\nstirred it round and round, and put it on the hob to simmer, Master\nPeter and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose,\nwith which they soon returned in high procession.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nSuch a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of\nall birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of\ncourse--and, in truth, it was something very like it in that house. Mrs.\nCratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing\nhot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss\nBelinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dust\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Then the shouting and the struggling, and the\nonslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him, with\nchairs for ladders, to dive into his pockets, despoil him of\nbrown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his\nneck, pummel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The\nshouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package\nwas received! The terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in\nthe act of putting a doll's frying pan into his mouth, and was more than\nsuspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden\nplatter! The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy, and\ngratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike.

Tut, don't I know?' she added in the same breath, laughing\nas he laughed. 'Mr. Scrooge.'\n\n'Mr. Scrooge it was.

His\npartner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat alone.\nQuite alone in the world, I do believe.'\n\n'Spirit!' said Scrooge in a broken voice, 'remove me from this place.'\n\n'I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,' said the\nGhost. 'That they are what they are do not blame me!'\n\n'Remove me!' Scrooge exclaimed, 'I cannot bear it!'\n\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a\nface, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces\nit had shown him, wrestled with it.\n\n'Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!'\n\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost\nwith no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort\nof its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and\nbright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized\nthe extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its\nhead.\n\n[Illustration: _Laden with Christmas toys and presents_]\n\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its\nwhole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he\ncould not hide the light, which streamed from under it, in an unbroken\nflood upon the ground.\n\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible\ndrowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a\nparting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel\nto bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nSTAVE THREE\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS\n\n\nAwaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in\nbed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told\nthat the bell was again upon the stroke of One. He felt that he was\nrestored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial\npurpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to\nhim through Jacob Marley's intervention. But finding that he turned\nuncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this\nnew spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own\nhands, and, lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the\nbed.

If these shadows\nremain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.'\n\n'No, no,' said Scrooge. 'Oh no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.'\n\n'If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future none other of my race,'\nreturned the Ghost, 'will find him here. What then? If he be like to\ndie, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.'\n\nScrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit, and\nwas overcome with penitence and grief.\n\n'Man,' said the Ghost, 'if man you be in heart, not adamant, forbear\nthat wicked cant until you have discovered what the surplus is, and\nwhere it is. Will you decide what men shall live, what men shall die? It\nmay be that, in the sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit\nto live than millions like this poor man's child. O God! to hear the\ninsect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry\nbrothers in the dust!'\n\nScrooge bent before the Ghost's rebuke, and, trembling, cast his eyes\nupon the ground. But he raised them speedily on hearing his own name.\n\n'Mr. Scrooge!' said Bob. 'I'll give you Mr. Scrooge, the Founder of the\nFeast!'\n\n'The Founder of the Feast, indeed!' cried Mrs. Cratchit, reddening. 'I\nwish I had him here. I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast upon, and\nI hope he'd have a good appetite for it.'\n\n'My dear,' said Bob, 'the children! Christmas Day.'\n\n'It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,' said she, 'on which one drinks\nthe health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as Mr.\nScrooge. You know he is, Robert! Nobody knows it better than you do,\npoor fellow!'\n\n'My dear!' was Bob's mild answer. 'Christmas Day.'\n\n'I'll drink his health for your sake and the Day's,' said Mrs. Cratchit,\n'not for his. Long life to him! A merry Christmas and a happy New Year!\nHe'll be very merry and very happy, I have no doubt!'\n\nThe children drank the toast after her. It was the first of their\nproceedings which had no heartiness in it. Tiny Tim drank it last of\nall, but he didn't care twopence for it. Scrooge was the Ogre of the\nfamily. The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party, which\nwas not dispelled for full five minutes.\n\nAfter it had passed away they were ten times merrier than before, from\nthe mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with. Bob Cratchit\ntold them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which\nwould bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly. The two\nyoung Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter's being a man\nof business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from\nbetween his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular\ninvestments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that\nbewildering income. Martha, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner's,\nthen told them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she\nworked at a stretch and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for\na good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home. Also how\nshe had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord\n'was much about as tall as Peter'; at which Peter pulled up his collar\nso high that you couldn't have seen his head if you had been there. All\nthis time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and by-and-by\nthey had a song, about a lost child travelling in the snow, from Tiny\nTim, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed.\n\nThere was nothing of high mark in this. They were not a handsome family;\nthey were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being waterproof;\ntheir clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely\ndid, the inside of a pawnbroker's. But they were happy, grateful,\npleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they\nfaded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit's\ntorch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny\nTim, until the last.\n\nBy this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as\nScrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the\nroaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms was\nwonderful. Here, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a\ncosy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the fire,\nand deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.\nThere, all the children of the house were running out into the snow to\nmeet their married sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the\nfirst to greet them.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone.

Mrs.\nCratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing\nhot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss\nBelinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob\ntook Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young\nCratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and,\nmounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest\nthey should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At\nlast the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a\nbreathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the\ncarving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did,\nand when the long-expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of\ndelight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two\nyoung Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife and\nfeebly cried Hurrah!\n\n[Illustration: HE HAD BEEN TIM'S BLOOD-HORSE ALL THE WAY FROM CHURCH]\n\nThere never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe there ever was\nsuch a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness,\nwere the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple sauce and\nmashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family;\nindeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small\natom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at last! Yet every\none had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits, in particular, were\nsteeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being\nchanged by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous\nto bear witnesses--to take the pudding up, and bring it in.\n\nSuppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning\nout! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard and\nstolen it, while they were merry with the goose--a supposition at which\nthe two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were\nsupposed.\n\nHallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell\nlike a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and\na pastry-cook's next door to each other, with a laundress's next door to\nthat! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit\nentered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding, like a speckled\ncannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of\nignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.\n\nOh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he\nregarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since\ntheir marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that, now the weight was off her\nmind, she would confess she had her doubts about the quantity of flour.\nEverybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it\nwas at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat\nheresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a\nthing.\n\n[Illustration: WITH THE PUDDING]\n\nAt last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth\nswept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted and\nconsidered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a\nshovel full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family\ndrew round the hearth in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half\na one; and at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass.\nTwo tumblers and a custard cup without a handle.\n\nThese held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden\ngoblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while\nthe chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob\nproposed:\n\n'A merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!'\n\nWhich all the family re-echoed.\n\n'God bless us every one!' said Tiny Tim, the last of all.\n\nHe sat very close to his father's side, upon his little stool. Bob held\nhis withered little hand to his, as if he loved the child, and wished to\nkeep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.\n\n'Spirit,' said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, 'tell\nme if Tiny Tim will live.'\n\n'I see a vacant seat,' replied the Ghost, 'in the poor chimney corner,\nand a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows\nremain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.'\n\n'No, no,' said Scrooge. 'Oh no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.'\n\n'If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future none other of my race,'\nreturned the Ghost, '\n######################\nOutput:"}}

For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\nappearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.\n\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being\nacquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time of\nday, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing\nthat they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter;\nbetween which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide\nand comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite\nas hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you to believe that he was\nready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing\nbetween a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\n\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means\nprepared for nothing; and consequently, when the bell struck One, and no\nshape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five\nminutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.\nAll this time he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze\nof ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\nhour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen\nghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at;\nand was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an\ninteresting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the\nconsolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you\nor I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the\npredicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would\nunquestionably have done it too--at last, I say, he began to think that\nthe source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining\nroom, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea\ntaking full possession of his mind, he got up softly, and shuffled in\nhis slippers to the door.\n\nThe moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by\nhis name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.\n\nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone\na surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with\nliving green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which\nbright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe,\nand ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been\nscattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as\nthat dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time,\nor Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the\nfloor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry,\nbrawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,\nmince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,\ncherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense\ntwelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim\nwith their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch there sat a\njolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not\nunlike Plenty's horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on\nScrooge as he came peeping round the door.\n\n'Come in!' exclaimed the Ghost. 'Come in! and know me better, man!'\n\nScrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was\nnot the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit's eyes were\nclear and kind, he did not like to meet them.\n\n'I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,' said the Spirit. 'Look upon me!'\n\nScrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple deep green robe,\nor mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the\nfigure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be\nwarded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the\nample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no\nother covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining\nicicles. Its dark-brown curls were long and free; free as its genial\nface, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its\nunconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was\nan antique scabbard: but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was\neaten up with rust.\n\n'You have never seen the like of me before!' exclaimed the Spirit.\n\n'Never,' Scrooge made answer to it.\n\n'Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning\n(for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?'\npursued the Phantom.\n\n'I don't think I have,' said Scrooge. 'I am afraid I have not. Have\n######################\nOutput:"}}

'Your nephew!'\n\nScrooge seemed uneasy in his mind, and answered briefly, 'Yes.'\n\nAlthough they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were\nnow in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed\nand re-passed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and\nall the strife and tumult of a real city were.

'Was I apprenticed here?'\n\nThey went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting\nbehind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller, he must\nhave knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great\nexcitement--\n\n'Why, it's old Fezziwig!

Is it a foot or a\nclaw?'\n\n'It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,' was the Spirit's\nsorrowful reply. 'Look here!'\n\nFrom the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject,\nfrightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung\nupon the outside of its garment.\n\n'O Man! look here! Look, look down here!' exclaimed the Ghost.\n\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but\nprostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\nfilled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a\nstale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted\nthem, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat\nenthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no\ndegradation, no perversion of humanity in any grade, through all the\nmysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and\ndread.\n\nScrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he\ntried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves,\nrather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\n\n'Spirit! are they yours?' Scrooge could say no more.\n\n'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they\ncling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This\ngirl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of\nall beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,\nunless the writing be erased. Deny it!' cried the Spirit, stretching out\nhis hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for\nyour factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!'\n\n'Have they no refuge or resource?' cried Scrooge.\n\n'Are there no prisons?' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last\ntime with his own words. 'Are there no workhouses?'\n\nThe bell struck Twelve.\n\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last\nstroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob\nMarley, and, lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and\nhooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.\n\n\nSTAVE FOUR\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST OF THE SPIRITS\n\n\nThe Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near him,\nScrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this\nSpirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\n\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched\nhand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\nsurrounded.\n\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n\n'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said\nScrooge.\n\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n\n'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\nbut will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,\nSpirit?'\n\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\nhe received.\n\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\nrecover.\n\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,\nuncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\nheap of black.\n\n'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre\nI have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope\nto live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your\ncompany, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?'\n\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n\n'Lead on!' said Scrooge. 'Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is\nprecious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!'\n\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in\nthe shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him\nalong.\n\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to\nspring up about them, and encompass them of its own act.

Here, again, were shadows on the window-blinds of\nguests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and\nfur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near\nneighbour's house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them\nenter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!\n\nBut, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to\nfriendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to\ngive them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting\ncompany, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how\nthe Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its\ncapacious palm, and floated on, outpouring with a generous hand its\nbright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very\nlamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of\nlight, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out\nloudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that\nhe had any company but Christmas.\n\nAnd now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a\nbleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast\nabout, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread\nitself wheresoever it listed; or would have done so, but for the frost\nthat held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse,\nrank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery\nred, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye,\nand frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of\ndarkest night.\n\n'What place is this?' asked Scrooge.\n\n'A place where miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,'\nreturned the Spirit. 'But they know me. See!'\n\nA light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced\ntowards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a\ncheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and\nwoman, with their children and their children's children, and another\ngeneration beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.\nThe old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind\nupon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song; it had been a\nvery old song when he was a boy; and from time to time they all joined\nin the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got\nquite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank\nagain.\n\nThe Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and,\npassing on above the moor, sped whither? Not to sea? To sea. To\nScrooge's horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful\nrange of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the\nthundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the\ndreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\n\nBuilt upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore,\non which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there\nstood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of seaweed clung to its base,\nand storm-birds--born of the wind, one might suppose, as seaweed of the\nwater--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\n\nBut, even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that\nthrough the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of\nbrightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough\ntable at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their\ncan of grog; and one of them--the elder too, with his face all damaged\nand scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might\nbe--struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself.\n\nAgain the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea--on, on--until\nbeing far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a\nship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the\nbow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their\nseveral stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or\nhad a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of\nsome bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And\nevery man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder\nword for one another on that day than on any day in the year; and had\nshared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he\ncared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember\nhim.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful\nyoung girl, so like that last that Scrooge believed it was the same,\nuntil he saw _her_, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter.\nThe noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more\nchildren there than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count;\nand, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not forty\nchildren conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting\nitself like forty. The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but\nno one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed\nheartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to\nmingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most\nruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of them! Though I\nnever could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn't for the wealth of all\nthe world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and for the\nprecious little shoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my soul!\nto save my life.

Think\nof that! Bob had but fifteen 'Bob' a week himself; he pocketed on\nSaturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of\nChristmas Present blessed his four-roomed house!\n\nThen up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed out but poorly in a\ntwice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap, and make a\ngoodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda\nCratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master\nPeter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and getting\nthe corners of his monstrous shirt-collar (Bob's private property,\nconferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day,) into his mouth,\nrejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to show his\nlinen in the fashionable Parks. And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and\ngirl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker's they had smelt\nthe goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious thoughts\nof sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about the table, and\nexalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he (not proud,\nalthough his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the slow\npotatoes, bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out\nand peeled.\n\n'What has ever got your precious father, then?' said Mrs. Cratchit. 'And\nyour brother, Tiny Tim? And Martha warn't as late last Christmas Day by\nhalf an hour!'\n\n'Here's Martha, mother!' said a girl, appearing as she spoke.\n\n'Here's Martha, mother!' cried the two young Cratchits. 'Hurrah! There's\n_such_ a goose, Martha!'\n\n'Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!' said Mrs.\nCratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet\nfor her with officious zeal.\n\n'We'd a deal of work to finish up last night,' replied the girl, 'and\nhad to clear away this morning, mother!'\n\n'Well! never mind so long as you are come,' said Mrs. Cratchit. 'Sit ye\ndown before the fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless ye!'\n\n'No, no! There's father coming,' cried the two young Cratchits, who were\neverywhere at once. 'Hide, Martha, hide!'\n\nSo Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father, with at least\nthree feet of comforter, exclusive of the fringe, hanging down before\nhim, and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed to look\nseasonable, and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a\nlittle crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame!\n\n'Why, where's our Martha?' cried Bob Cratchit, looking round.\n\n'Not coming,' said Mrs. Cratchit.\n\n'Not coming!' said Bob, with a sudden declension in his high spirits;\nfor he had been Tim's blood-horse all the way from church, and had come\nhome rampant. 'Not coming upon Christmas Day!'\n\nMartha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only in joke; so\nshe came out prematurely from behind the closet door, and ran into his\narms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off\ninto the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in the\ncopper.\n\n'And how did little Tim behave?' asked Mrs. Cratchit when she had\nrallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to his\nheart's content.\n\n'As good as gold,' said Bob, 'and better. Somehow, he gets thoughtful,\nsitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever\nheard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the\nchurch, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to\nremember upon Christmas Day who made lame beggars walk and blind men\nsee.'\n\nBob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when\nhe said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty.\n\nHis active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny\nTim before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and\nsister to his stool beside the fire; and while Bob, turning up his\ncuffs--as if, poor fellow, they were capable of being made more\nshabby--compounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and\nstirred it round and round, and put it on the hob to simmer, Master\nPeter and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose,\nwith which they soon returned in high procession.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nSuch a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of\nall birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of\ncourse--and, in truth, it was something very like it in that house. Mrs.\nCratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing\nhot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss\nBelinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dust\n######################\nOutput:"}}

I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast upon, and\nI hope he'd have a good appetite for it.'\n\n'My dear,' said Bob, 'the children! Christmas Day.'\n\n'It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,' said she, 'on which one drinks\nthe health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as Mr.\nScrooge. You know he is, Robert! Nobody knows it better than you do,\npoor fellow!'\n\n'My dear!' was Bob's mild answer. 'Christmas Day.'\n\n'I'll drink his health for your sake and the Day's,' said Mrs. Cratchit,\n'not for his. Long life to him! A merry Christmas and a happy New Year!\nHe'll be very merry and very happy, I have no doubt!'\n\nThe children drank the toast after her. It was the first of their\nproceedings which had no heartiness in it. Tiny Tim drank it last of\nall, but he didn't care twopence for it. Scrooge was the Ogre of the\nfamily. The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party, which\nwas not dispelled for full five minutes.\n\nAfter it had passed away they were ten times merrier than before, from\nthe mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with. Bob Cratchit\ntold them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which\nwould bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly. The two\nyoung Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter's being a man\nof business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from\nbetween his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular\ninvestments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that\nbewildering income. Martha, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner's,\nthen told them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she\nworked at a stretch and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for\na good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home. Also how\nshe had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord\n'was much about as tall as Peter'; at which Peter pulled up his collar\nso high that you couldn't have seen his head if you had been there. All\nthis time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and by-and-by\nthey had a song, about a lost child travelling in the snow, from Tiny\nTim, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed.\n\nThere was nothing of high mark in this. They were not a handsome family;\nthey were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being waterproof;\ntheir clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely\ndid, the inside of a pawnbroker's. But they were happy, grateful,\npleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they\nfaded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit's\ntorch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny\nTim, until the last.\n\nBy this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as\nScrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the\nroaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms was\nwonderful. Here, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a\ncosy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the fire,\nand deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.\nThere, all the children of the house were running out into the snow to\nmeet their married sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the\nfirst to greet them. Here, again, were shadows on the window-blinds of\nguests assembling; and there a group of\n######################\nOutput:"}}

For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\nappearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.\n\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being\nacquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time of\nday, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing\nthat they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter;\nbetween which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide\nand comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite\nas hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you to believe that he was\nready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing\nbetween a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\n\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means\nprepared for nothing; and consequently, when the bell struck One, and no\nshape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five\nminutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.\nAll this time he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze\nof ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\nhour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen\nghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at;\nand was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an\ninteresting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the\nconsolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you\nor I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the\npredicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would\nunquestionably have done it too--at last, I say, he began to think that\nthe source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining\nroom, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea\ntaking full possession of his mind, he got up softly, and shuffled in\nhis slippers to the door.\n\nThe moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by\nhis name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.\n\nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone\na surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with\nliving green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which\nbright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe,\nand ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been\nscattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as\nthat dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time,\nor Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the\nfloor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry,\nbrawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,\nmince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,\ncherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense\ntwelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim\nwith their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch there sat a\njolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not\nunlike Plenty's horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on\nScrooge as he came peeping round the door.\n\n'Come in!' exclaimed the Ghost. 'Come in! and know me better, man!'\n\nScrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was\nnot the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit's eyes were\nclear and kind, he did not like to meet them.\n\n'I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,' said the Spirit. 'Look upon me!'\n\nScrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple deep green robe,\nor mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the\nfigure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be\nwarded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the\nample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no\nother covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining\nicicles. Its dark-brown curls were long and free; free as its genial\nface, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its\nunconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was\nan antique scabbard: but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was\neaten up with rust.\n\n'You have never seen the like of me before!' exclaimed the Spirit.\n\n'Never,' Scrooge made answer to it.\n\n'Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning\n(for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?'\npursued the Phantom.\n\n'I don't think I have,' said Scrooge.

Mrs.\nCratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing\nhot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss\nBelinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob\ntook Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young\nCratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and,\nmounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest\nthey should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At\nlast the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a\nbreathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the\ncarving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did,\nand when the long-expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of\ndelight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two\nyoung Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife and\nfeebly cried Hurrah!\n\n[Illustration: HE HAD BEEN TIM'S BLOOD-HORSE ALL THE WAY FROM CHURCH]\n\nThere never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe there ever was\nsuch a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness,\nwere the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple sauce and\nmashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family;\nindeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small\natom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at last! Yet every\none had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits, in particular, were\nsteeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being\nchanged by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous\nto bear witnesses--to take the pudding up, and bring it in.\n\nSuppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning\nout! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard and\nstolen it, while they were merry with the goose--a supposition at which\nthe two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were\nsupposed.\n\nHallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell\nlike a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and\na pastry-cook's next door to each other, with a laundress's next door to\nthat! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit\nentered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding, like a speckled\ncannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of\nignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.\n\nOh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he\nregarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since\ntheir marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that, now the weight was off her\nmind, she would confess she had her doubts about the quantity of flour.\nEverybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it\nwas at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat\nheresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a\nthing.\n\n[Illustration: WITH THE PUDDING]\n\nAt last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth\nswept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted and\nconsidered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a\nshovel full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family\ndrew round the hearth in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half\na one; and at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass.\nTwo tumblers and a custard cup without a handle.\n\nThese held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden\ngoblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while\nthe chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob\nproposed:\n\n'A merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!'\n\nWhich all the family re-echoed.\n\n'God bless us every one!' said Tiny Tim, the last of all.\n\nHe sat very close to his father's side, upon his little stool. Bob held\nhis withered little hand to his, as if he loved the child, and wished to\nkeep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.\n\n'Spirit,' said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, 'tell\nme if Tiny Tim will live.'\n\n'I see a vacant seat,' replied the Ghost, 'in the poor chimney corner,\nand a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows\nremain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.'\n\n'No, no,' said Scrooge. 'Oh no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.'\n\n'If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future none other of my race,'\nreturned the Ghost, '\n######################\nOutput:"}}

INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\ntrademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\nproviding copies of Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works in\naccordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the\nproduction, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg\u2122\nelectronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,\nincluding legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of\nthe following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this\nor any Project Gutenberg\u2122 work, (b) alteration, modification, or\nadditions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg\u2122 work, and (c) any\nDefect you cause.\n\nSection 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Then the shouting and the struggling, and the\nonslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him, with\nchairs for ladders, to dive into his pockets, despoil him of\nbrown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his\nneck, pummel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The\nshouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package\nwas received! The terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in\nthe act of putting a doll's frying pan into his mouth, and was more than\nsuspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden\nplatter!

Tut, don't I know?' she added in the same breath, laughing\nas he laughed. 'Mr. Scrooge.'\n\n'Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as it was not shut\nup, and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing him. His\npartner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat alone.\nQuite alone in the world, I do believe.'\n\n'Spirit!' said Scrooge in a broken voice, 'remove me from this place.'\n\n'I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,' said the\nGhost. 'That they are what they are do not blame me!'\n\n'Remove me!' Scrooge exclaimed, 'I cannot bear it!'\n\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a\nface, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces\nit had shown him, wrestled with it.\n\n'Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!'\n\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost\nwith no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort\nof its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and\nbright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized\nthe extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its\nhead.\n\n[Illustration: _Laden with Christmas toys and presents_]\n\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its\nwhole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he\ncould not hide the light, which streamed from under it, in an unbroken\nflood upon the ground.\n\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible\ndrowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a\nparting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel\nto bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nSTAVE THREE\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS\n\n\nAwaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in\nbed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told\nthat the bell was again upon the stroke of One. He felt that he was\nrestored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial\npurpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to\nhim through Jacob Marley's intervention. But finding that he turned\nuncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this\nnew spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own\nhands, and, lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the\nbed.

'Look here!'\n\nFrom the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject,\nfrightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung\nupon the outside of its garment.\n\n'O Man! look here! Look, look down here!' exclaimed the Ghost.\n\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but\nprostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\nfilled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a\nstale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted\nthem, and pulled them into shreds.

Scrooge could say no more.\n\n'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they\ncling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This\ngirl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of\nall beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,\nunless the writing be erased. Deny it!' cried the Spirit, stretching out\nhis hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for\nyour factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!'\n\n'Have they no refuge or resource?' cried Scrooge.\n\n'Are there no prisons?' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last\ntime with his own words. 'Are there no workhouses?'\n\nThe bell struck Twelve.\n\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last\nstroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob\nMarley, and, lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and\nhooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.\n\n\nSTAVE FOUR\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST OF THE SPIRITS\n\n\nThe Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near him,\nScrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this\nSpirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\n\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched\nhand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\nsurrounded.\n\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n\n'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said\nScrooge.\n\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n\n'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\nbut will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,\nSpirit?'\n\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\nhe received.\n\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\nrecover.\n\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,\nuncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\nheap of black.\n\n'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre\nI have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope\nto live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your\ncompany, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?'\n\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n\n'Lead on!' said Scrooge. 'Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is\nprecious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!'\n\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in\nthe shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him\nalong.\n\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to\nspring up about them, and encompass them of its own act.

I should like to have given him something:\nthat's all.'\n\nThe Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand, saying as it did so,\n'Let us see another Christmas!'\n\nScrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a\nlittle darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk, the windows cracked;\nfragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were\nshown instead; but how all this was brought about Scrooge knew no more\nthan you do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything had\nhappened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had\ngone home for the jolly holidays.\n\nHe was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge\nlooked at the Ghost, and, with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced\nanxiously towards the door.\n\nIt opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting\nin, and, putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him,\naddressed him as her 'dear, dear brother.'\n\n'I have come to bring you home, dear brother!' said the child, clapping\nher tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. 'To bring you home, home,\nhome!'\n\n'Home, little Fan?' returned the boy.\n\n'Yes!' said the child, brimful of glee. 'Home for good and all. Home for\never and ever. Father is so much kinder than he used to be, that home's\nlike heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to\nbed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home;\nand he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring you. And\nyou're to be a man!' said the child, opening her eyes; 'and are never to\ncome back here; but first we're to be together all the Christmas long,\nand have the merriest time in all the world.'\n\n'You are quite a woman, little Fan!' exclaimed the boy.\n\nShe clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but,\nbeing too little laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him. Then\nshe began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door; and\nhe, nothing loath to go, accompanied her.\n\nA terrible voice in the hall cried, 'Bring down Master Scrooge's box,\nthere!' and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on\nMaster Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a\ndreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him\nand his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best parlour\nthat ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and\nterrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced\na decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake,\nand administered instalments of those dainties to the young people; at\nthe same time sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of\n'something' to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman,\nbut, if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had rather not.\nMaster Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the\nchaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly;\nand, getting into it, drove gaily down the garden sweep; the quick\nwheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the\nevergreens like spray.\n\n[Illustration: HE PRODUCED A DECANTER OF CURIOUSLY LIGHT WINE, AND A\nBLOCK OF CURIOUSLY HEAVY CAKE]\n\n'Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,' said\nthe Ghost. 'But she had a large heart!'\n\n'So she had,' cried Scrooge. 'You're right. I will not gainsay it,\nSpirit. God forbid!'\n\n'She died a woman,' said the Ghost, 'and had, as I think, children.'\n\n'One child,' Scrooge returned.\n\n'True,' said the Ghost. 'Your nephew!'\n\nScrooge seemed uneasy in his mind, and answered briefly, 'Yes.'\n\nAlthough they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were\nnow in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed\nand re-passed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and\nall the strife and tumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough,\nby the dressing of the shops, that here, too, it was Christmas-time\nagain; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.\n\nThe Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he\nknew it.\n\n'Know it!' said Scrooge. 'Was I apprenticed here?'\n\nThey went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting\nbehind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller, he must\nhave knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great\nexcitement--\n\n'Why, it's old Fezziwig!

If these shadows\nremain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.'\n\n'No, no,' said Scrooge. 'Oh no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.'\n\n'If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future none other of my race,'\nreturned the Ghost, 'will find him here. What then? If he be like to\ndie, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.'\n\nScrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit, and\nwas overcome with penitence and grief.\n\n'Man,' said the Ghost, 'if man you be in heart, not adamant, forbear\nthat wicked cant until you have discovered what the surplus is, and\nwhere it is. Will you decide what men shall live, what men shall die? It\nmay be that, in the sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit\nto live than millions like this poor man's child. O God! to hear the\ninsect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry\nbrothers in the dust!'\n\nScrooge bent before the Ghost's rebuke, and, trembling, cast his eyes\nupon the ground. But he raised them speedily on hearing his own name.\n\n'Mr. Scrooge!' said Bob. 'I'll give you Mr. Scrooge, the Founder of the\nFeast!'\n\n'The Founder of the Feast, indeed!' cried Mrs. Cratchit, reddening. 'I\nwish I had him here. I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast upon, and\nI hope he'd have a good appetite for it.'\n\n'My dear,' said Bob, 'the children! Christmas Day.'\n\n'It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,' said she, 'on which one drinks\nthe health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as Mr.\nScrooge. You know he is, Robert! Nobody knows it better than you do,\npoor fellow!'\n\n'My dear!' was Bob's mild answer. 'Christmas Day.'\n\n'I'll drink his health for your sake and the Day's,' said Mrs. Cratchit,\n'not for his. Long life to him! A merry Christmas and a happy New Year!\nHe'll be very merry and very happy, I have no doubt!'\n\nThe children drank the toast after her. It was the first of their\nproceedings which had no heartiness in it. Tiny Tim drank it last of\nall, but he didn't care twopence for it. Scrooge was the Ogre of the\nfamily. The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party, which\nwas not dispelled for full five minutes.\n\nAfter it had passed away they were ten times merrier than before, from\nthe mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with. Bob Cratchit\ntold them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which\nwould bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly. The two\nyoung Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter's being a man\nof business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from\nbetween his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular\ninvestments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that\nbewildering income. Martha, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner's,\nthen told them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she\nworked at a stretch and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for\na good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home. Also how\nshe had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord\n'was much about as tall as Peter'; at which Peter pulled up his collar\nso high that you couldn't have seen his head if you had been there. All\nthis time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and by-and-by\nthey had a song, about a lost child travelling in the snow, from Tiny\nTim, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed.\n\nThere was nothing of high mark in this. They were not a handsome family;\nthey were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being waterproof;\ntheir clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely\ndid, the inside of a pawnbroker's. But they were happy, grateful,\npleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they\nfaded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit's\ntorch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny\nTim, until the last.\n\nBy this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as\nScrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the\nroaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms was\nwonderful. Here, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a\ncosy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the fire,\nand deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.\nThere, all the children of the house were running out into the snow to\nmeet their married sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the\nfirst to greet them.

Here, again, were shadows on the window-blinds of\nguests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and\nfur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near\nneighbour's house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them\nenter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!\n\nBut, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to\nfriendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to\ngive them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting\ncompany, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how\nthe Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its\ncapacious palm, and floated on, outpouring with a generous hand its\nbright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very\nlamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of\nlight, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out\nloudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that\nhe had any company but Christmas.\n\nAnd now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a\nbleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast\nabout, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread\nitself wheresoever it listed; or would have done so, but for the frost\nthat held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse,\nrank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery\nred, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye,\nand frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of\ndarkest night.\n\n'What place is this?' asked Scrooge.\n\n'A place where miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,'\nreturned the Spirit. 'But they know me. See!'\n\nA light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced\ntowards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a\ncheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and\nwoman, with their children and their children's children, and another\ngeneration beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.\nThe old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind\nupon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song; it had been a\nvery old song when he was a boy; and from time to time they all joined\nin the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got\nquite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank\nagain.\n\nThe Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and,\npassing on above the moor, sped whither? Not to sea? To sea. To\nScrooge's horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful\nrange of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the\nthundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the\ndreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\n\nBuilt upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore,\non which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there\nstood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of seaweed clung to its base,\nand storm-birds--born of the wind, one might suppose, as seaweed of the\nwater--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\n\nBut, even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that\nthrough the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of\nbrightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough\ntable at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their\ncan of grog; and one of them--the elder too, with his face all damaged\nand scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might\nbe--struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself.\n\nAgain the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea--on, on--until\nbeing far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a\nship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the\nbow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their\nseveral stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or\nhad a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of\nsome bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And\nevery man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder\nword for one another on that day than on any day in the year; and had\nshared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he\ncared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember\nhim.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Mrs.\nCratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing\nhot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss\nBelinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob\ntook Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young\nCratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and,\nmounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest\nthey should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At\nlast the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a\nbreathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the\ncarving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did,\nand when the long-expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of\ndelight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two\nyoung Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife and\nfeebly cried Hurrah!\n\n[Illustration: HE HAD BEEN TIM'S BLOOD-HORSE ALL THE WAY FROM CHURCH]\n\nThere never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe there ever was\nsuch a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness,\nwere the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple sauce and\nmashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family;\nindeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small\natom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at last! Yet every\none had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits, in particular, were\nsteeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being\nchanged by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous\nto bear witnesses--to take the pudding up, and bring it in.\n\nSuppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning\nout! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard and\nstolen it, while they were merry with the goose--a supposition at which\nthe two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were\nsupposed.\n\nHallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell\nlike a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and\na pastry-cook's next door to each other, with a laundress's next door to\nthat! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit\nentered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding, like a speckled\ncannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of\nignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.\n\nOh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he\nregarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since\ntheir marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that, now the weight was off her\nmind, she would confess she had her doubts about the quantity of flour.\nEverybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it\nwas at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat\nheresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a\nthing.\n\n[Illustration: WITH THE PUDDING]\n\nAt last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth\nswept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted and\nconsidered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a\nshovel full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family\ndrew round the hearth in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half\na one; and at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass.\nTwo tumblers and a custard cup without a handle.\n\nThese held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden\ngoblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while\nthe chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob\nproposed:\n\n'A merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!'\n\nWhich all the family re-echoed.\n\n'God bless us every one!' said Tiny Tim, the last of all.\n\nHe sat very close to his father's side, upon his little stool. Bob held\nhis withered little hand to his, as if he loved the child, and wished to\nkeep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.\n\n'Spirit,' said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, 'tell\nme if Tiny Tim will live.'\n\n'I see a vacant seat,' replied the Ghost, 'in the poor chimney corner,\nand a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows\nremain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.'\n\n'No, no,' said Scrooge. 'Oh no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.'\n\n'If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future none other of my race,'\nreturned the Ghost, '\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Haunt me no longer!'\n\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost\nwith no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort\nof its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and\nbright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized\nthe extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its\nhead.\n\n[Illustration: _Laden with Christmas toys and presents_]\n\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its\nwhole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he\ncould not hide the light, which streamed from under it, in an unbroken\nflood upon the ground.\n\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible\ndrowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a\nparting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel\nto bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nSTAVE THREE\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS\n\n\nAwaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in\nbed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told\nthat the bell was again upon the stroke of One. He felt that he was\nrestored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial\npurpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to\nhim through Jacob Marley's intervention. But finding that he turned\nuncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this\nnew spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own\nhands, and, lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the\nbed. For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\nappearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.\n\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being\n######################\nOutput:"}}

For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\nappearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.\n\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being\nacquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time of\nday, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing\nthat they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter;\nbetween which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide\nand comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite\nas hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you to believe that he was\nready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing\nbetween a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\n\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means\nprepared for nothing; and consequently, when the bell struck One, and no\nshape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five\nminutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.\nAll this time he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze\nof ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\nhour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen\nghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at;\nand was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an\ninteresting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the\nconsolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you\nor I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the\npredicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would\nunquestionably have done it too--at last, I say, he began to think that\nthe source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining\nroom, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea\ntaking full possession of his mind, he got up softly, and shuffled in\nhis slippers to the door.\n\nThe moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by\nhis name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.\n\nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone\na surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with\nliving green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which\nbright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe,\nand ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been\nscattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as\nthat dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time,\nor Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the\nfloor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry,\nbrawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,\nmince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,\ncherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense\ntwelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim\nwith their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch there sat a\njolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not\nunlike Plenty's horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on\nScrooge as he came peeping round the door.\n\n'Come in!' exclaimed the Ghost. 'Come in! and know me better, man!'\n\nScrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was\nnot the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit's eyes were\nclear and kind, he did not like to meet them.\n\n'I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,' said the Spirit. 'Look upon me!'\n\nScrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple deep green robe,\nor mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the\nfigure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be\nwarded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the\nample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no\nother covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining\nicicles. Its dark-brown curls were long and free; free as its genial\nface, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its\nunconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was\nan antique scabbard: but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was\neaten up with rust.\n\n'You have never seen the like of me before!' exclaimed the Spirit.\n\n'Never,' Scrooge made answer to it.\n\n'Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning\n(for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?'\npursued the Phantom.\n\n'I don't think I have,' said Scrooge. 'I am afraid I have not. Have\n######################\nOutput:"}}

They knelt down at its feet, and clung\nupon the outside of its garment.\n\n'O Man! look here! Look, look down here!' exclaimed the Ghost.\n\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but\nprostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\nfilled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a\nstale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted\nthem, and pulled them into shreds.

Scrooge could say no more.\n\n'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they\ncling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This\ngirl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of\nall beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,\nunless the writing be erased.

And bide the end!'\n\n'Have they no refuge or resource?' cried Scrooge.\n\n'Are there no prisons?' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last\ntime with his own words. 'Are there no workhouses?'\n\nThe bell struck Twelve.\n\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last\nstroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob\nMarley, and, lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and\nhooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.\n\n\nSTAVE FOUR\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST OF THE SPIRITS\n\n\nThe Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near him,\nScrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this\nSpirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\n\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched\nhand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\nsurrounded.\n\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n\n'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said\nScrooge.\n\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n\n'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\nbut will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,\nSpirit?'\n\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\nhe received.\n\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\nrecover.\n\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,\nuncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\nheap of black.\n\n'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre\nI have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope\nto live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your\ncompany, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?'\n\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n\n'Lead on!' said Scrooge. 'Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is\nprecious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!'\n\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in\nthe shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him\nalong.\n\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to\nspring up about them, and encompass them of its own act.

INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\ntrademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\nproviding copies of Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works in\naccordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the\nproduction, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg\u2122\nelectronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,\nincluding legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of\nthe following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this\nor any Project Gutenberg\u2122 work, (b) alteration, modification, or\nadditions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg\u2122 work, and (c) any\nDefect you cause.\n\nSection 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

And\nyou're to be a man!' said the child, opening her eyes; 'and are never to\ncome back here; but first we're to be together all the Christmas long,\nand have the merriest time in all the world.'\n\n'You are quite a woman, little Fan!' exclaimed the boy.\n\nShe clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but,\nbeing too little laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him. Then\nshe began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door; and\nhe, nothing loath to go, accompanied her.\n\nA terrible voice in the hall cried, 'Bring down Master Scrooge's box,\nthere!' and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on\nMaster Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a\ndreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him\nand his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best parlour\nthat ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and\nterrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced\na decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake,\nand administered instalments of those dainties to the young people; at\nthe same time sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of\n'something' to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman,\nbut, if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had rather not.\nMaster Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the\nchaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly;\nand, getting into it, drove gaily down the garden sweep; the quick\nwheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the\nevergreens like spray.\n\n[Illustration: HE PRODUCED A DECANTER OF CURIOUSLY LIGHT WINE, AND A\nBLOCK OF CURIOUSLY HEAVY CAKE]\n\n'Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,' said\nthe Ghost. 'But she had a large heart!'\n\n'So she had,' cried Scrooge. 'You're right. I will not gainsay it,\nSpirit. God forbid!'\n\n'She died a woman,' said the Ghost, 'and had, as I think, children.'\n\n'One child,' Scrooge returned.\n\n'True,' said the Ghost. 'Your nephew!'\n\nScrooge seemed uneasy in his mind, and answered briefly, 'Yes.'\n\nAlthough they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were\nnow in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed\nand re-passed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and\nall the strife and tumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough,\nby the dressing of the shops, that here, too, it was Christmas-time\nagain; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.\n\nThe Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he\nknew it.\n\n'Know it!' said Scrooge. 'Was I apprenticed here?'\n\nThey went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting\nbehind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller, he must\nhave knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great\nexcitement--\n\n'Why, it's old Fezziwig! Bless his heart, it's Fezziwig alive again!'\n\nOld Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which\npointed to\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Christmas Day.'\n\n'It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,' said she, 'on which one drinks\nthe health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as Mr.\nScrooge. You know he is, Robert! Nobody knows it better than you do,\npoor fellow!'\n\n'My dear!' was Bob's mild answer. 'Christmas Day.'\n\n'I'll drink his health for your sake and the Day's,' said Mrs. Cratchit,\n'not for his. Long life to him! A merry Christmas and a happy New Year!\nHe'll be very merry and very happy, I have no doubt!'\n\nThe children drank the toast after her. It was the first of their\nproceedings which had no heartiness in it. Tiny Tim drank it last of\nall, but he didn't care twopence for it. Scrooge was the Ogre of the\nfamily. The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party, which\nwas not dispelled for full five minutes.\n\nAfter it had passed away they were ten times merrier than before, from\nthe mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with. Bob Cratchit\ntold them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which\nwould bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly. The two\nyoung Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter's being a man\nof business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from\nbetween his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular\ninvestments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that\nbewildering income. Martha, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner's,\nthen told them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she\nworked at a stretch and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for\na good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home. Also how\nshe had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord\n'was much about as tall as Peter'; at which Peter pulled up his collar\nso high that you couldn't have seen his head if you had been there. All\nthis time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and by-and-by\nthey had a song, about a lost child travelling in the snow, from Tiny\nTim, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed.\n\nThere was nothing of high mark in this. They were not a handsome family;\nthey were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being waterproof;\ntheir clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely\ndid, the inside of a pawnbroker's. But they were happy, grateful,\npleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they\nfaded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit's\ntorch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny\nTim, until the last.\n\nBy this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as\nScrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the\nroaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms was\nwonderful. Here, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a\ncosy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the fire,\nand deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.\nThere, all the children of the house were running out into the snow to\nmeet their married sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the\nfirst to greet them. Here, again, were shadows on the window-blinds of\nguests assembling; and there a group of\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Here, again, were shadows on the window-blinds of\nguests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and\nfur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near\nneighbour's house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them\nenter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!\n\nBut, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to\nfriendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to\ngive them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting\ncompany, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how\nthe Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its\ncapacious palm, and floated on, outpouring with a generous hand its\nbright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very\nlamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of\nlight, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out\nloudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that\nhe had any company but Christmas.\n\nAnd now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a\nbleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast\nabout, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread\nitself wheresoever it listed; or would have done so, but for the frost\nthat held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse,\nrank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery\nred, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye,\nand frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of\ndarkest night.\n\n'What place is this?' asked Scrooge.\n\n'A place where miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,'\nreturned the Spirit. 'But they know me. See!'\n\nA light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced\ntowards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a\ncheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and\nwoman, with their children and their children's children, and another\ngeneration beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.\nThe old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind\nupon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song; it had been a\nvery old song when he was a boy; and from time to time they all joined\nin the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got\nquite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank\nagain.\n\nThe Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and,\npassing on above the moor, sped whither? Not to sea? To sea. To\nScrooge's horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful\nrange of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the\nthundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the\ndreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\n\nBuilt upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore,\non which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there\nstood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of seaweed clung to its base,\nand storm-birds--born of the wind, one might suppose, as seaweed of the\nwater--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\n\nBut, even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that\nthrough the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of\nbrightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough\ntable at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their\ncan of grog; and one of them--the elder too, with his face all damaged\nand scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might\nbe--struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself.\n\nAgain the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea--on, on--until\nbeing far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a\nship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the\nbow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their\nseveral stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or\nhad a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of\nsome bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And\nevery man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder\nword for one another on that day than on any day in the year; and had\nshared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he\ncared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember\nhim.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Mrs.\nCratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing\nhot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss\nBelinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob\ntook Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young\nCratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and,\nmounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest\nthey should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At\nlast the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a\nbreathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the\ncarving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did,\nand when the long-expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of\ndelight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two\nyoung Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife and\nfeebly cried Hurrah!\n\n[Illustration: HE HAD BEEN TIM'S BLOOD-HORSE ALL THE WAY FROM CHURCH]\n\nThere never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe there ever was\nsuch a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness,\nwere the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple sauce and\nmashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family;\nindeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small\natom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at last! Yet every\none had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits, in particular, were\nsteeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being\nchanged by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous\nto bear witnesses--to take the pudding up, and bring it in.\n\nSuppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning\nout! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard and\nstolen it, while they were merry with the goose--a supposition at which\nthe two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were\nsupposed.\n\nHallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell\nlike a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and\na pastry-cook's next door to each other, with a laundress's next door to\nthat! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit\nentered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding, like a speckled\ncannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of\nignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.\n\nOh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he\nregarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since\ntheir marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that, now the weight was off her\nmind, she would confess she had her doubts about the quantity of flour.\nEverybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it\nwas at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat\nheresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a\nthing.\n\n[Illustration: WITH THE PUDDING]\n\nAt last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth\nswept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted and\nconsidered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a\nshovel full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family\ndrew round the hearth in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half\na one; and at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass.\nTwo tumblers and a custard cup without a handle.\n\nThese held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden\ngoblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while\nthe chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob\nproposed:\n\n'A merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!'\n\nWhich all the family re-echoed.\n\n'God bless us every one!' said Tiny Tim, the last of all.\n\nHe sat very close to his father's side, upon his little stool. Bob held\nhis withered little hand to his, as if he loved the child, and wished to\nkeep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.\n\n'Spirit,' said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, 'tell\nme if Tiny Tim will live.'\n\n'I see a vacant seat,' replied the Ghost, 'in the poor chimney corner,\nand a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows\nremain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.'\n\n'No, no,' said Scrooge. 'Oh no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.'\n\n'If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future none other of my race,'\nreturned the Ghost, '\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but\nno one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed\nheartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to\nmingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most\nruthlessly.

And\nyet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have\nquestioned her, that she might have opened them; to have looked upon the\nlashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let loose\nwaves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price: in\nshort, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest\nlicense of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Scrooge exclaimed, 'I cannot bear it!'\n\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a\nface, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces\nit had shown him, wrestled with it.\n\n'Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!'\n\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost\nwith no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort\nof its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and\nbright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized\nthe extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its\nhead.\n\n[Illustration: _Laden with Christmas toys and presents_]\n\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its\nwhole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he\ncould not hide the light, which streamed from under it, in an unbroken\nflood upon the ground.\n\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible\ndrowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a\nparting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel\nto bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nSTAVE THREE\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS\n\n\nAwaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in\nbed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told\nthat the bell was again upon the stroke of One. He felt that he was\nrestored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial\npurpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to\nhim through Jacob Marley's intervention. But finding that he turned\nuncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this\nnew spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own\nhands, and, lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the\nbed. For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\nappearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.\n\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being\n######################\nOutput:"}}

'Look here!'\n\nFrom the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject,\nfrightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung\nupon the outside of its garment.\n\n'O Man! look here! Look, look down here!' exclaimed the Ghost.\n\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but\nprostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\nfilled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a\nstale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted\nthem, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat\nenthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no\ndegradation, no perversion of humanity in any grade, through all the\nmysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and\ndread.\n\nScrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he\ntried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves,\nrather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\n\n'Spirit! are they yours?' Scrooge could say no more.\n\n'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they\ncling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This\ngirl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of\nall beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,\nunless the writing be erased. Deny it!' cried the Spirit, stretching out\nhis hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for\nyour factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!'\n\n'Have they no refuge or resource?' cried Scrooge.\n\n'Are there no prisons?' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last\ntime with his own words. 'Are there no workhouses?'\n\nThe bell struck Twelve.\n\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last\nstroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob\nMarley, and, lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and\nhooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.\n\n\nSTAVE FOUR\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST OF THE SPIRITS\n\n\nThe Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near him,\nScrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this\nSpirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\n\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched\nhand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\nsurrounded.\n\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n\n'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said\nScrooge.\n\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n\n'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\nbut will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,\nSpirit?'\n\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\nhe received.\n\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\nrecover.\n\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,\nuncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\nheap of black.\n\n'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre\nI have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope\nto live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your\ncompany, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?'\n\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n\n'Lead on!' said Scrooge. 'Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is\nprecious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!'\n\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in\nthe shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him\nalong.\n\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to\nspring up about them, and encompass them of its own act.

For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\nappearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.\n\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being\nacquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time of\nday, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing\nthat they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter;\nbetween which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide\nand comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite\nas hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you to believe that he was\nready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing\nbetween a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\n\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means\nprepared for nothing; and consequently, when the bell struck One, and no\nshape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five\nminutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.\nAll this time he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze\nof ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\nhour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen\nghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at;\nand was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an\ninteresting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the\nconsolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you\nor I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the\npredicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would\nunquestionably have done it too--at last, I say, he began to think that\nthe source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining\nroom, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea\ntaking full possession of his mind, he got up softly, and shuffled in\nhis slippers to the door.\n\nThe moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by\nhis name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.\n\nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone\na surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with\nliving green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which\nbright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe,\nand ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been\nscattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as\nthat dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time,\nor Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the\nfloor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry,\nbrawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,\nmince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,\ncherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense\ntwelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim\nwith their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch there sat a\njolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not\nunlike Plenty's horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on\nScrooge as he came peeping round the door.\n\n'Come in!' exclaimed the Ghost. 'Come in! and know me better, man!'\n\nScrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was\nnot the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit's eyes were\nclear and kind, he did not like to meet them.\n\n'I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,' said the Spirit. 'Look upon me!'\n\nScrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple deep green robe,\nor mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the\nfigure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be\nwarded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the\nample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no\nother covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining\nicicles. Its dark-brown curls were long and free; free as its genial\nface, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its\nunconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was\nan antique scabbard: but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was\neaten up with rust.\n\n'You have never seen the like of me before!' exclaimed the Spirit.\n\n'Never,' Scrooge made answer to it.\n\n'Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning\n(for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?'\npursued the Phantom.\n\n'I don't think I have,' said Scrooge. 'I am afraid I have not. Have\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone.

I should like to have given him something:\nthat's all.'\n\nThe Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand, saying as it did so,\n'Let us see another Christmas!'\n\nScrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a\nlittle darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk, the windows cracked;\nfragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were\nshown instead; but how all this was brought about Scrooge knew no more\nthan you do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything had\nhappened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had\ngone home for the jolly holidays.\n\nHe was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge\nlooked at the Ghost, and, with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced\nanxiously towards the door.\n\nIt opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting\nin, and, putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him,\naddressed him as her 'dear, dear brother.'\n\n'I have come to bring you home, dear brother!' said the child, clapping\nher tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. 'To bring you home, home,\nhome!'\n\n'Home, little Fan?' returned the boy.\n\n'Yes!' said the child, brimful of glee. 'Home for good and all. Home for\never and ever. Father is so much kinder than he used to be, that home's\nlike heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to\nbed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home;\nand he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring you. And\nyou're to be a man!' said the child, opening her eyes; 'and are never to\ncome back here; but first we're to be together all the Christmas long,\nand have the merriest time in all the world.'\n\n'You are quite a woman, little Fan!' exclaimed the boy.\n\nShe clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but,\nbeing too little laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him. Then\nshe began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door; and\nhe, nothing loath to go, accompanied her.\n\nA terrible voice in the hall cried, 'Bring down Master Scrooge's box,\nthere!' and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on\nMaster Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a\ndreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him\nand his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best parlour\nthat ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and\nterrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced\na decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake,\nand administered instalments of those dainties to the young people; at\nthe same time sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of\n'something' to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman,\nbut, if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had rather not.\nMaster Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the\nchaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly;\nand, getting into it, drove gaily down the garden sweep; the quick\nwheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the\nevergreens like spray.\n\n[Illustration: HE PRODUCED A DECANTER OF CURIOUSLY LIGHT WINE, AND A\nBLOCK OF CURIOUSLY HEAVY CAKE]\n\n'Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,' said\nthe Ghost. 'But she had a large heart!'\n\n'So she had,' cried Scrooge. 'You're right. I will not gainsay it,\nSpirit. God forbid!'\n\n'She died a woman,' said the Ghost, 'and had, as I think, children.'\n\n'One child,' Scrooge returned.\n\n'True,' said the Ghost. 'Your nephew!'\n\nScrooge seemed uneasy in his mind, and answered briefly, 'Yes.'\n\nAlthough they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were\nnow in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed\nand re-passed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and\nall the strife and tumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough,\nby the dressing of the shops, that here, too, it was Christmas-time\nagain; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.\n\nThe Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he\nknew it.\n\n'Know it!' said Scrooge. 'Was I apprenticed here?'\n\nThey went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting\nbehind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller, he must\nhave knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great\nexcitement--\n\n'Why, it's old Fezziwig!

Here, again, were shadows on the window-blinds of\nguests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and\nfur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near\nneighbour's house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them\nenter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!\n\nBut, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to\nfriendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to\ngive them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting\ncompany, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how\nthe Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its\ncapacious palm, and floated on, outpouring with a generous hand its\nbright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very\nlamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of\nlight, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out\nloudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that\nhe had any company but Christmas.\n\nAnd now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a\nbleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast\nabout, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread\nitself wheresoever it listed; or would have done so, but for the frost\nthat held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse,\nrank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery\nred, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye,\nand frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of\ndarkest night.\n\n'What place is this?' asked Scrooge.\n\n'A place where miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,'\nreturned the Spirit. 'But they know me. See!'\n\nA light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced\ntowards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a\ncheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and\nwoman, with their children and their children's children, and another\ngeneration beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.\nThe old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind\nupon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song; it had been a\nvery old song when he was a boy; and from time to time they all joined\nin the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got\nquite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank\nagain.\n\nThe Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and,\npassing on above the moor, sped whither? Not to sea? To sea. To\nScrooge's horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful\nrange of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the\nthundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the\ndreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\n\nBuilt upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore,\non which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there\nstood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of seaweed clung to its base,\nand storm-birds--born of the wind, one might suppose, as seaweed of the\nwater--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\n\nBut, even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that\nthrough the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of\nbrightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough\ntable at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their\ncan of grog; and one of them--the elder too, with his face all damaged\nand scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might\nbe--struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself.\n\nAgain the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea--on, on--until\nbeing far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a\nship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the\nbow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their\nseveral stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or\nhad a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of\nsome bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And\nevery man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder\nword for one another on that day than on any day in the year; and had\nshared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he\ncared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember\nhim.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Mrs.\nCratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing\nhot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss\nBelinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob\ntook Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young\nCratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and,\nmounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest\nthey should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At\nlast the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a\nbreathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the\ncarving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did,\nand when the long-expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of\ndelight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two\nyoung Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife and\nfeebly cried Hurrah!\n\n[Illustration: HE HAD BEEN TIM'S BLOOD-HORSE ALL THE WAY FROM CHURCH]\n\nThere never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe there ever was\nsuch a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness,\nwere the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple sauce and\nmashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family;\nindeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small\natom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at last! Yet every\none had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits, in particular, were\nsteeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being\nchanged by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous\nto bear witnesses--to take the pudding up, and bring it in.\n\nSuppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning\nout! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard and\nstolen it, while they were merry with the goose--a supposition at which\nthe two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were\nsupposed.\n\nHallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell\nlike a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and\na pastry-cook's next door to each other, with a laundress's next door to\nthat! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit\nentered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding, like a speckled\ncannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of\nignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.\n\nOh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he\nregarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since\ntheir marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that, now the weight was off her\nmind, she would confess she had her doubts about the quantity of flour.\nEverybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it\nwas at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat\nheresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a\nthing.\n\n[Illustration: WITH THE PUDDING]\n\nAt last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth\nswept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted and\nconsidered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a\nshovel full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family\ndrew round the hearth in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half\na one; and at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass.\nTwo tumblers and a custard cup without a handle.\n\nThese held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden\ngoblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while\nthe chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob\nproposed:\n\n'A merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!'\n\nWhich all the family re-echoed.\n\n'God bless us every one!' said Tiny Tim, the last of all.\n\nHe sat very close to his father's side, upon his little stool. Bob held\nhis withered little hand to his, as if he loved the child, and wished to\nkeep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.\n\n'Spirit,' said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, 'tell\nme if Tiny Tim will live.'\n\n'I see a vacant seat,' replied the Ghost, 'in the poor chimney corner,\nand a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows\nremain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.'\n\n'No, no,' said Scrooge. 'Oh no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.'\n\n'If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future none other of my race,'\nreturned the Ghost, '\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The\nshouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package\nwas received!

'That they are what they are do not blame me!'\n\n'Remove me!' Scrooge exclaimed, 'I cannot bear it!'\n\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a\nface, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces\nit had shown him, wrestled with it.\n\n'Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!'\n\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost\nwith no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort\nof its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and\nbright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized\nthe extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its\nhead.\n\n[Illustration: _Laden with Christmas toys and presents_]\n\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its\nwhole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he\ncould not hide the light, which streamed from under it, in an unbroken\nflood upon the ground.\n\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible\ndrowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom.

He felt that he was\nrestored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial\npurpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to\nhim through Jacob Marley's intervention. But finding that he turned\nuncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this\nnew spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own\nhands, and, lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the\nbed.

Is it a foot or a\nclaw?'\n\n'It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,' was the Spirit's\nsorrowful reply. 'Look here!'\n\nFrom the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject,\nfrightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung\nupon the outside of its garment.\n\n'O Man! look here! Look, look down here!' exclaimed the Ghost.\n\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but\nprostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\nfilled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a\nstale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted\nthem, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat\nenthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no\ndegradation, no perversion of humanity in any grade, through all the\nmysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and\ndread.\n\nScrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he\ntried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves,\nrather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\n\n'Spirit! are they yours?' Scrooge could say no more.\n\n'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they\ncling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This\ngirl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of\nall beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,\nunless the writing be erased. Deny it!' cried the Spirit, stretching out\nhis hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for\nyour factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!'\n\n'Have they no refuge or resource?' cried Scrooge.\n\n'Are there no prisons?' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last\ntime with his own words. 'Are there no workhouses?'\n\nThe bell struck Twelve.\n\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last\nstroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob\nMarley, and, lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and\nhooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.\n\n\nSTAVE FOUR\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST OF THE SPIRITS\n\n\nThe Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near him,\nScrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this\nSpirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\n\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched\nhand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\nsurrounded.\n\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n\n'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said\nScrooge.\n\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n\n'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\nbut will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,\nSpirit?'\n\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\nhe received.\n\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\nrecover.\n\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,\nuncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\nheap of black.\n\n'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre\nI have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope\nto live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your\ncompany, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?'\n\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n\n'Lead on!' said Scrooge. 'Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is\nprecious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!'\n\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in\nthe shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him\nalong.\n\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to\nspring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there they\nwere in the heart of it; on 'Change, amongst the merchants,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.

General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\nappearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.\n\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being\nacquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time of\nday, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing\nthat they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter;\nbetween which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide\nand comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite\nas hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you to believe that he was\nready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing\nbetween a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\n\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means\nprepared for nothing; and consequently, when the bell struck One, and no\nshape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five\nminutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.\nAll this time he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze\nof ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\nhour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen\nghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at;\nand was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an\ninteresting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the\nconsolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you\nor I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the\npredicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would\nunquestionably have done it too--at last, I say, he began to think that\nthe source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining\nroom, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea\ntaking full possession of his mind, he got up softly, and shuffled in\nhis slippers to the door.\n\nThe moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by\nhis name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.\n\nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone\na surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with\nliving green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which\nbright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe,\nand ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been\nscattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as\nthat dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time,\nor Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the\nfloor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry,\nbrawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,\nmince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,\ncherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense\ntwelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim\nwith their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch there sat a\njolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not\nunlike Plenty's horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on\nScrooge as he came peeping round the door.\n\n'Come in!' exclaimed the Ghost. 'Come in! and know me better, man!'\n\nScrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was\nnot the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit's eyes were\nclear and kind, he did not like to meet them.\n\n'I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,' said the Spirit. 'Look upon me!'\n\nScrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple deep green robe,\nor mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the\nfigure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be\nwarded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the\nample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no\nother covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining\nicicles. Its dark-brown curls were long and free; free as its genial\nface, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its\nunconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was\nan antique scabbard: but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was\neaten up with rust.\n\n'You have never seen the like of me before!' exclaimed the Spirit.\n\n'Never,' Scrooge made answer to it.\n\n'Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning\n(for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?'\npursued the Phantom.\n\n'I don't think I have,' said Scrooge. 'I am afraid I have not. Have\n######################\nOutput:"}}

I should like to have given him something:\nthat's all.'\n\nThe Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand, saying as it did so,\n'Let us see another Christmas!'\n\nScrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a\nlittle darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk, the windows cracked;\nfragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were\nshown instead; but how all this was brought about Scrooge knew no more\nthan you do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything had\nhappened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had\ngone home for the jolly holidays.\n\nHe was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge\nlooked at the Ghost, and, with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced\nanxiously towards the door.\n\nIt opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting\nin, and, putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him,\naddressed him as her 'dear, dear brother.'\n\n'I have come to bring you home, dear brother!' said the child, clapping\nher tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. 'To bring you home, home,\nhome!'\n\n'Home, little Fan?' returned the boy.\n\n'Yes!' said the child, brimful of glee. 'Home for good and all. Home for\never and ever. Father is so much kinder than he used to be, that home's\nlike heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to\nbed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home;\nand he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring you. And\nyou're to be a man!' said the child, opening her eyes; 'and are never to\ncome back here; but first we're to be together all the Christmas long,\nand have the merriest time in all the world.'\n\n'You are quite a woman, little Fan!' exclaimed the boy.\n\nShe clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but,\nbeing too little laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him. Then\nshe began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door; and\nhe, nothing loath to go, accompanied her.\n\nA terrible voice in the hall cried, 'Bring down Master Scrooge's box,\nthere!' and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on\nMaster Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a\ndreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him\nand his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best parlour\nthat ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and\nterrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced\na decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake,\nand administered instalments of those dainties to the young people; at\nthe same time sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of\n'something' to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman,\nbut, if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had rather not.\nMaster Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the\nchaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly;\nand, getting into it, drove gaily down the garden sweep; the quick\nwheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the\nevergreens like spray.\n\n[Illustration: HE PRODUCED A DECANTER OF CURIOUSLY LIGHT WINE, AND A\nBLOCK OF CURIOUSLY HEAVY CAKE]\n\n'Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,' said\nthe Ghost. 'But she had a large heart!'\n\n'So she had,' cried Scrooge. 'You're right. I will not gainsay it,\nSpirit. God forbid!'\n\n'She died a woman,' said the Ghost, 'and had, as I think, children.'\n\n'One child,' Scrooge returned.\n\n'True,' said the Ghost. 'Your nephew!'\n\nScrooge seemed uneasy in his mind, and answered briefly, 'Yes.'\n\nAlthough they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were\nnow in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed\nand re-passed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and\nall the strife and tumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough,\nby the dressing of the shops, that here, too, it was Christmas-time\nagain; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.\n\nThe Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he\nknew it.\n\n'Know it!' said Scrooge. 'Was I apprenticed here?'\n\nThey went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting\nbehind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller, he must\nhave knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great\nexcitement--\n\n'Why, it's old Fezziwig!

Here, again, were shadows on the window-blinds of\nguests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and\nfur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near\nneighbour's house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them\nenter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!\n\nBut, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to\nfriendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to\ngive them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting\ncompany, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how\nthe Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its\ncapacious palm, and floated on, outpouring with a generous hand its\nbright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very\nlamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of\nlight, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out\nloudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that\nhe had any company but Christmas.\n\nAnd now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a\nbleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast\nabout, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread\nitself wheresoever it listed; or would have done so, but for the frost\nthat held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse,\nrank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery\nred, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye,\nand frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of\ndarkest night.\n\n'What place is this?' asked Scrooge.\n\n'A place where miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,'\nreturned the Spirit. 'But they know me. See!'\n\nA light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced\ntowards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a\ncheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and\nwoman, with their children and their children's children, and another\ngeneration beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.\nThe old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind\nupon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song; it had been a\nvery old song when he was a boy; and from time to time they all joined\nin the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got\nquite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank\nagain.\n\nThe Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and,\npassing on above the moor, sped whither? Not to sea? To sea. To\nScrooge's horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful\nrange of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the\nthundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the\ndreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\n\nBuilt upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore,\non which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there\nstood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of seaweed clung to its base,\nand storm-birds--born of the wind, one might suppose, as seaweed of the\nwater--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\n\nBut, even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that\nthrough the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of\nbrightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough\ntable at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their\ncan of grog; and one of them--the elder too, with his face all damaged\nand scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might\nbe--struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself.\n\nAgain the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea--on, on--until\nbeing far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a\nship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the\nbow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their\nseveral stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or\nhad a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of\nsome bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And\nevery man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder\nword for one another on that day than on any day in the year; and had\nshared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he\ncared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember\nhim.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Mrs.\nCratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing\nhot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss\nBelinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob\ntook Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young\nCratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and,\nmounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest\nthey should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At\nlast the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a\nbreathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the\ncarving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did,\nand when the long-expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of\ndelight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two\nyoung Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife and\nfeebly cried Hurrah!\n\n[Illustration: HE HAD BEEN TIM'S BLOOD-HORSE ALL THE WAY FROM CHURCH]\n\nThere never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe there ever was\nsuch a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness,\nwere the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple sauce and\nmashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family;\nindeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small\natom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at last! Yet every\none had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits, in particular, were\nsteeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being\nchanged by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous\nto bear witnesses--to take the pudding up, and bring it in.\n\nSuppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning\nout! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard and\nstolen it, while they were merry with the goose--a supposition at which\nthe two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were\nsupposed.\n\nHallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell\nlike a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and\na pastry-cook's next door to each other, with a laundress's next door to\nthat! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit\nentered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding, like a speckled\ncannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of\nignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.\n\nOh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he\nregarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since\ntheir marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that, now the weight was off her\nmind, she would confess she had her doubts about the quantity of flour.\nEverybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it\nwas at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat\nheresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a\nthing.\n\n[Illustration: WITH THE PUDDING]\n\nAt last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth\nswept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted and\nconsidered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a\nshovel full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family\ndrew round the hearth in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half\na one; and at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass.\nTwo tumblers and a custard cup without a handle.\n\nThese held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden\ngoblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while\nthe chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob\nproposed:\n\n'A merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!'\n\nWhich all the family re-echoed.\n\n'God bless us every one!' said Tiny Tim, the last of all.\n\nHe sat very close to his father's side, upon his little stool. Bob held\nhis withered little hand to his, as if he loved the child, and wished to\nkeep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.\n\n'Spirit,' said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, 'tell\nme if Tiny Tim will live.'\n\n'I see a vacant seat,' replied the Ghost, 'in the poor chimney corner,\nand a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows\nremain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.'\n\n'No, no,' said Scrooge. 'Oh no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.'\n\n'If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future none other of my race,'\nreturned the Ghost, '\n######################\nOutput:"}}

For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\nappearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.\n\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being\nacquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time of\nday, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing\nthat they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter;\nbetween which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide\nand comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite\nas hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you to believe that he was\nready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing\nbetween a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\n\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means\nprepared for nothing; and consequently, when the bell struck One, and no\nshape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five\nminutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.\nAll this time he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze\nof ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\nhour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen\nghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at;\nand was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an\ninteresting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the\nconsolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you\nor I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the\npredicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would\nunquestionably have done it too--at last, I say, he began to think that\nthe source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining\nroom, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea\ntaking full possession of his mind, he got up softly, and shuffled in\nhis slippers to the door.\n\nThe moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by\nhis name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.\n\nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone\na surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with\nliving green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which\nbright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe,\nand ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been\nscattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as\nthat dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time,\nor Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the\nfloor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry,\nbrawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,\nmince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,\ncherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense\ntwelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim\nwith their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch there sat a\njolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not\nunlike Plenty's horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on\nScrooge as he came peeping round the door.\n\n'Come in!' exclaimed the Ghost. 'Come in! and know me better, man!'\n\nScrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was\nnot the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit's eyes were\nclear and kind, he did not like to meet them.\n\n'I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,' said the Spirit. 'Look upon me!'\n\nScrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple deep green robe,\nor mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the\nfigure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be\nwarded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the\nample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no\nother covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining\nicicles. Its dark-brown curls were long and free; free as its genial\nface, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its\nunconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was\nan antique scabbard: but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was\neaten up with rust.\n\n'You have never seen the like of me before!' exclaimed the Spirit.\n\n'Never,' Scrooge made answer to it.\n\n'Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning\n(for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?'\npursued the Phantom.\n\n'I don't think I have,' said Scrooge. 'I am afraid I have not. Have\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but\nno one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed\nheartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to\nmingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most\nruthlessly.

INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\ntrademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\nproviding copies of Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works in\naccordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the\nproduction, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg\u2122\nelectronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,\nincluding legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of\nthe following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this\nor any Project Gutenberg\u2122 work, (b) alteration, modification, or\nadditions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg\u2122 work, and (c) any\nDefect you cause.\n\nSection 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Then the shouting and the struggling, and the\nonslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him, with\nchairs for ladders, to dive into his pockets, despoil him of\nbrown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his\nneck, pummel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The\nshouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package\nwas received! The terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in\nthe act of putting a doll's frying pan into his mouth, and was more than\nsuspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden\nplatter! The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy, and\ngratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike. It is enough\nthat, by degrees, the children and their emotions got out of the\nparlour, and, by one stair at a time, up to the top of the house, where\nthey went to bed, and so subsided.\n\nAnd now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of\nthe house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her\nand her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such\nanother creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have\ncalled him father, and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his\nlife, his sight grew very dim indeed.\n\n'Belle,' said the husband, turning to his wife with a smile, 'I saw an\nold friend of yours this afternoon.'\n\n'Who was it?'\n\n'Guess!'\n\n'How can I? Tut, don't I know?' she added in the same breath, laughing\nas he laughed. 'Mr. Scrooge.'\n\n'Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as it was not shut\nup, and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing him. His\npartner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat alone.\nQuite alone in the world, I do believe.'\n\n'Spirit!' said Scrooge in a broken voice, 'remove me from this place.'\n\n'I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,' said the\nGhost. 'That they are what they are do not blame me!'\n\n'Remove me!' Scrooge exclaimed, 'I cannot bear it!'\n\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a\nface, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces\nit had shown him, wrestled with it.\n\n'Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!'\n\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost\nwith no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort\nof its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and\nbright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized\nthe extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its\nhead.\n\n[Illustration: _Laden with Christmas toys and presents_]\n\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its\nwhole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he\ncould not hide the light, which streamed from under it, in an unbroken\nflood upon the ground.\n\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible\ndrowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a\nparting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel\nto bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nSTAVE THREE\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS\n\n\nAwaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in\nbed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told\nthat the bell was again upon the stroke of One. He felt that he was\nrestored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial\npurpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to\nhim through Jacob Marley's intervention. But finding that he turned\nuncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this\nnew spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own\nhands, and, lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the\nbed. For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\nappearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.\n\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being\n######################\nOutput:"}}

'Look here!'\n\nFrom the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject,\nfrightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung\nupon the outside of its garment.\n\n'O Man! look here! Look, look down here!' exclaimed the Ghost.\n\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but\nprostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\nfilled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a\nstale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted\nthem, and pulled them into shreds.

Deny it!' cried the Spirit, stretching out\nhis hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for\nyour factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!'\n\n'Have they no refuge or resource?' cried Scrooge.\n\n'Are there no prisons?' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last\ntime with his own words. 'Are there no workhouses?'\n\nThe bell struck Twelve.\n\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not.

When it came near him,\nScrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this\nSpirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\n\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched\nhand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\nsurrounded.\n\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n\n'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said\nScrooge.\n\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n\n'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\nbut will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,\nSpirit?'\n\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\nhe received.\n\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\nrecover.\n\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,\nuncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\nheap of black.\n\n'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre\nI have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope\nto live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your\ncompany, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?'\n\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n\n'Lead on!' said Scrooge. 'Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is\nprecious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!'\n\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him.

Father is so much kinder than he used to be, that home's\nlike heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to\nbed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home;\nand he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring you. And\nyou're to be a man!' said the child, opening her eyes; 'and are never to\ncome back here; but first we're to be together all the Christmas long,\nand have the merriest time in all the world.'\n\n'You are quite a woman, little Fan!' exclaimed the boy.\n\nShe clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but,\nbeing too little laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him. Then\nshe began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door; and\nhe, nothing loath to go, accompanied her.\n\nA terrible voice in the hall cried, 'Bring down Master Scrooge's box,\nthere!' and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on\nMaster Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a\ndreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him\nand his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best parlour\nthat ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and\nterrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced\na decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake,\nand administered instalments of those dainties to the young people; at\nthe same time sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of\n'something' to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman,\nbut, if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had rather not.\nMaster Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the\nchaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly;\nand, getting into it, drove gaily down the garden sweep; the quick\nwheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the\nevergreens like spray.\n\n[Illustration: HE PRODUCED A DECANTER OF CURIOUSLY LIGHT WINE, AND A\nBLOCK OF CURIOUSLY HEAVY CAKE]\n\n'Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,' said\nthe Ghost. 'But she had a large heart!'\n\n'So she had,' cried Scrooge. 'You're right. I will not gainsay it,\nSpirit. God forbid!'\n\n'She died a woman,' said the Ghost, 'and had, as I think, children.'\n\n'One child,' Scrooge returned.\n\n'True,' said the Ghost. 'Your nephew!'\n\nScrooge seemed uneasy in his mind, and answered briefly, 'Yes.'\n\nAlthough they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were\nnow in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed\nand re-passed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and\nall the strife and tumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough,\nby the dressing of the shops, that here, too, it was Christmas-time\nagain; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.\n\nThe Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he\nknew it.\n\n'Know it!' said Scrooge. 'Was I apprenticed here?'\n\nThey went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting\nbehind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller, he must\nhave knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great\nexcitement--\n\n'Why, it's old Fezziwig! Bless his heart, it's Fezziwig alive again!'\n\nOld Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which\npointed to\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Here, again, were shadows on the window-blinds of\nguests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and\nfur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near\nneighbour's house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them\nenter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!\n\nBut, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to\nfriendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to\ngive them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting\ncompany, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how\nthe Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its\ncapacious palm, and floated on, outpouring with a generous hand its\nbright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very\nlamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of\nlight, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out\nloudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that\nhe had any company but Christmas.\n\nAnd now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a\nbleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast\nabout, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread\nitself wheresoever it listed; or would have done so, but for the frost\nthat held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse,\nrank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery\nred, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye,\nand frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of\ndarkest night.\n\n'What place is this?' asked Scrooge.\n\n'A place where miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,'\nreturned the Spirit. 'But they know me. See!'\n\nA light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced\ntowards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a\ncheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and\nwoman, with their children and their children's children, and another\ngeneration beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.\nThe old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind\nupon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song; it had been a\nvery old song when he was a boy; and from time to time they all joined\nin the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got\nquite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank\nagain.\n\nThe Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and,\npassing on above the moor, sped whither? Not to sea? To sea. To\nScrooge's horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful\nrange of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the\nthundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the\ndreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\n\nBuilt upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore,\non which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there\nstood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of seaweed clung to its base,\nand storm-birds--born of the wind, one might suppose, as seaweed of the\nwater--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\n\nBut, even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that\nthrough the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of\nbrightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough\ntable at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their\ncan of grog; and one of them--the elder too, with his face all damaged\nand scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might\nbe--struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself.\n\nAgain the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea--on, on--until\nbeing far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a\nship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the\nbow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their\nseveral stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or\nhad a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of\nsome bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And\nevery man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder\nword for one another on that day than on any day in the year; and had\nshared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he\ncared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember\nhim.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Mrs.\nCratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing\nhot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss\nBelinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob\ntook Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young\nCratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and,\nmounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest\nthey should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At\nlast the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a\nbreathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the\ncarving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did,\nand when the long-expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of\ndelight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two\nyoung Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife and\nfeebly cried Hurrah!\n\n[Illustration: HE HAD BEEN TIM'S BLOOD-HORSE ALL THE WAY FROM CHURCH]\n\nThere never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe there ever was\nsuch a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness,\nwere the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple sauce and\nmashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family;\nindeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small\natom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at last! Yet every\none had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits, in particular, were\nsteeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being\nchanged by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous\nto bear witnesses--to take the pudding up, and bring it in.\n\nSuppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning\nout! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard and\nstolen it, while they were merry with the goose--a supposition at which\nthe two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were\nsupposed.\n\nHallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell\nlike a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and\na pastry-cook's next door to each other, with a laundress's next door to\nthat! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit\nentered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding, like a speckled\ncannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of\nignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.\n\nOh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he\nregarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since\ntheir marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that, now the weight was off her\nmind, she would confess she had her doubts about the quantity of flour.\nEverybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it\nwas at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat\nheresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a\nthing.\n\n[Illustration: WITH THE PUDDING]\n\nAt last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth\nswept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted and\nconsidered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a\nshovel full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family\ndrew round the hearth in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half\na one; and at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass.\nTwo tumblers and a custard cup without a handle.\n\nThese held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden\ngoblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while\nthe chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob\nproposed:\n\n'A merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!'\n\nWhich all the family re-echoed.\n\n'God bless us every one!' said Tiny Tim, the last of all.\n\nHe sat very close to his father's side, upon his little stool. Bob held\nhis withered little hand to his, as if he loved the child, and wished to\nkeep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.\n\n'Spirit,' said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, 'tell\nme if Tiny Tim will live.'\n\n'I see a vacant seat,' replied the Ghost, 'in the poor chimney corner,\nand a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows\nremain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.'\n\n'No, no,' said Scrooge. 'Oh no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.'\n\n'If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future none other of my race,'\nreturned the Ghost, '\n######################\nOutput:"}}

For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\nappearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.\n\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being\nacquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time of\nday, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing\nthat they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter;\nbetween which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide\nand comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite\nas hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you to believe that he was\nready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing\nbetween a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\n\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means\nprepared for nothing; and consequently, when the bell struck One, and no\nshape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five\nminutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.\nAll this time he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze\nof ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\nhour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen\nghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at;\nand was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an\ninteresting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the\nconsolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you\nor I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the\npredicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would\nunquestionably have done it too--at last, I say, he began to think that\nthe source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining\nroom, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea\ntaking full possession of his mind, he got up softly, and shuffled in\nhis slippers to the door.\n\nThe moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by\nhis name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.\n\nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone\na surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with\nliving green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which\nbright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe,\nand ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been\nscattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as\nthat dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time,\nor Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the\nfloor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry,\nbrawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,\nmince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,\ncherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense\ntwelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim\nwith their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch there sat a\njolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not\nunlike Plenty's horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on\nScrooge as he came peeping round the door.\n\n'Come in!' exclaimed the Ghost. 'Come in! and know me better, man!'\n\nScrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was\nnot the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit's eyes were\nclear and kind, he did not like to meet them.\n\n'I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,' said the Spirit. 'Look upon me!'\n\nScrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple deep green robe,\nor mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the\nfigure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be\nwarded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the\nample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no\nother covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining\nicicles. Its dark-brown curls were long and free; free as its genial\nface, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its\nunconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was\nan antique scabbard: but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was\neaten up with rust.\n\n'You have never seen the like of me before!' exclaimed the Spirit.\n\n'Never,' Scrooge made answer to it.\n\n'Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning\n(for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?'\npursued the Phantom.\n\n'I don't think I have,' said Scrooge.

Is it a foot or a\nclaw?'\n\n'It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,' was the Spirit's\nsorrowful reply. 'Look here!'\n\nFrom the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject,\nfrightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung\nupon the outside of its garment.\n\n'O Man! look here! Look, look down here!' exclaimed the Ghost.\n\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but\nprostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\nfilled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a\nstale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted\nthem, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat\nenthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no\ndegradation, no perversion of humanity in any grade, through all the\nmysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and\ndread.\n\nScrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he\ntried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves,\nrather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\n\n'Spirit! are they yours?' Scrooge could say no more.\n\n'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they\ncling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This\ngirl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of\nall beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,\nunless the writing be erased. Deny it!' cried the Spirit, stretching out\nhis hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for\nyour factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!'\n\n'Have they no refuge or resource?' cried Scrooge.\n\n'Are there no prisons?' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last\ntime with his own words. 'Are there no workhouses?'\n\nThe bell struck Twelve.\n\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last\nstroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob\nMarley, and, lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and\nhooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.\n\n\nSTAVE FOUR\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST OF THE SPIRITS\n\n\nThe Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near him,\nScrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this\nSpirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\n\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched\nhand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\nsurrounded.\n\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n\n'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said\nScrooge.\n\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n\n'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\nbut will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,\nSpirit?'\n\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\nhe received.\n\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\nrecover.\n\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,\nuncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\nheap of black.\n\n'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre\nI have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope\nto live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your\ncompany, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?'\n\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n\n'Lead on!' said Scrooge. 'Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is\nprecious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!'\n\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in\nthe shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him\nalong.\n\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to\nspring up about them, and encompass them of its own act.

I should like to have given him something:\nthat's all.'\n\nThe Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand, saying as it did so,\n'Let us see another Christmas!'\n\nScrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a\nlittle darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk, the windows cracked;\nfragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were\nshown instead; but how all this was brought about Scrooge knew no more\nthan you do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything had\nhappened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had\ngone home for the jolly holidays.\n\nHe was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge\nlooked at the Ghost, and, with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced\nanxiously towards the door.\n\nIt opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting\nin, and, putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him,\naddressed him as her 'dear, dear brother.'\n\n'I have come to bring you home, dear brother!' said the child, clapping\nher tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. 'To bring you home, home,\nhome!'\n\n'Home, little Fan?' returned the boy.\n\n'Yes!' said the child, brimful of glee. 'Home for good and all. Home for\never and ever. Father is so much kinder than he used to be, that home's\nlike heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to\nbed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home;\nand he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring you. And\nyou're to be a man!' said the child, opening her eyes; 'and are never to\ncome back here; but first we're to be together all the Christmas long,\nand have the merriest time in all the world.'\n\n'You are quite a woman, little Fan!' exclaimed the boy.\n\nShe clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but,\nbeing too little laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him. Then\nshe began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door; and\nhe, nothing loath to go, accompanied her.\n\nA terrible voice in the hall cried, 'Bring down Master Scrooge's box,\nthere!' and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on\nMaster Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a\ndreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him\nand his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best parlour\nthat ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and\nterrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced\na decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake,\nand administered instalments of those dainties to the young people; at\nthe same time sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of\n'something' to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman,\nbut, if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had rather not.\nMaster Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the\nchaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly;\nand, getting into it, drove gaily down the garden sweep; the quick\nwheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the\nevergreens like spray.\n\n[Illustration: HE PRODUCED A DECANTER OF CURIOUSLY LIGHT WINE, AND A\nBLOCK OF CURIOUSLY HEAVY CAKE]\n\n'Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,' said\nthe Ghost. 'But she had a large heart!'\n\n'So she had,' cried Scrooge. 'You're right. I will not gainsay it,\nSpirit.

'Your nephew!'\n\nScrooge seemed uneasy in his mind, and answered briefly, 'Yes.'\n\nAlthough they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were\nnow in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed\nand re-passed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and\nall the strife and tumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough,\nby the dressing of the shops, that here, too, it was Christmas-time\nagain; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.\n\nThe Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he\nknew it.\n\n'Know it!' said Scrooge.

Mrs.\nCratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing\nhot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss\nBelinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob\ntook Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young\nCratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and,\nmounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest\nthey should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At\nlast the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a\nbreathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the\ncarving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did,\nand when the long-expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of\ndelight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two\nyoung Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife and\nfeebly cried Hurrah!\n\n[Illustration: HE HAD BEEN TIM'S BLOOD-HORSE ALL THE WAY FROM CHURCH]\n\nThere never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe there ever was\nsuch a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness,\nwere the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple sauce and\nmashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family;\nindeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small\natom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at last! Yet every\none had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits, in particular, were\nsteeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being\nchanged by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous\nto bear witnesses--to take the pudding up, and bring it in.\n\nSuppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning\nout! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard and\nstolen it, while they were merry with the goose--a supposition at which\nthe two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were\nsupposed.\n\nHallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell\nlike a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and\na pastry-cook's next door to each other, with a laundress's next door to\nthat! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit\nentered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding, like a speckled\ncannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of\nignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.\n\nOh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he\nregarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since\ntheir marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that, now the weight was off her\nmind, she would confess she had her doubts about the quantity of flour.\nEverybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it\nwas at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat\nheresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a\nthing.\n\n[Illustration: WITH THE PUDDING]\n\nAt last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth\nswept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted and\nconsidered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a\nshovel full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family\ndrew round the hearth in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half\na one; and at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass.\nTwo tumblers and a custard cup without a handle.\n\nThese held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden\ngoblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while\nthe chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily.

Mrs.\nCratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing\nhot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss\nBelinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob\ntook Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young\nCratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and,\nmounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest\nthey should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At\nlast the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a\nbreathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the\ncarving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did,\nand when the long-expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of\ndelight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two\nyoung Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife and\nfeebly cried Hurrah!\n\n[Illustration: HE HAD BEEN TIM'S BLOOD-HORSE ALL THE WAY FROM CHURCH]\n\nThere never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe there ever was\nsuch a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness,\nwere the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple sauce and\nmashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family;\nindeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small\natom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at last! Yet every\none had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits, in particular, were\nsteeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being\nchanged by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous\nto bear witnesses--to take the pudding up, and bring it in.\n\nSuppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning\nout! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard and\nstolen it, while they were merry with the goose--a supposition at which\nthe two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were\nsupposed.\n\nHallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell\nlike a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and\na pastry-cook's next door to each other, with a laundress's next door to\nthat! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit\nentered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding, like a speckled\ncannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of\nignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.\n\nOh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he\nregarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since\ntheir marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that, now the weight was off her\nmind, she would confess she had her doubts about the quantity of flour.\nEverybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it\nwas at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat\nheresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a\nthing.\n\n[Illustration: WITH THE PUDDING]\n\nAt last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth\nswept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted and\nconsidered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a\nshovel full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family\ndrew round the hearth in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half\na one; and at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass.\nTwo tumblers and a custard cup without a handle.\n\nThese held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden\ngoblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while\nthe chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob\nproposed:\n\n'A merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!'\n\nWhich all the family re-echoed.\n\n'God bless us every one!' said Tiny Tim, the last of all.\n\nHe sat very close to his father's side, upon his little stool.

Without venturing for Scrooge quite\nas hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you to believe that he was\nready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing\nbetween a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\n\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means\nprepared for nothing; and consequently, when the bell struck One, and no\nshape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five\nminutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.\nAll this time he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze\nof ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\nhour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen\nghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at;\nand was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an\ninteresting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the\nconsolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you\nor I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the\npredicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would\nunquestionably have done it too--at last, I say, he began to think that\nthe source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining\nroom, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea\ntaking full possession of his mind, he got up softly, and shuffled in\nhis slippers to the door.\n\nThe moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by\nhis name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.\n\nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone\na surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with\nliving green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which\nbright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe,\nand ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been\nscattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as\nthat dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time,\nor Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the\nfloor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry,\nbrawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,\nmince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,\ncherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense\ntwelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim\nwith their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch there sat a\njolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not\nunlike Plenty's horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on\nScrooge as he came peeping round the door.\n\n'Come in!' exclaimed the Ghost. 'Come in! and know me better, man!'\n\nScrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was\nnot the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit's eyes were\nclear and kind, he did not like to meet them.\n\n'I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,' said the Spirit. 'Look upon me!'\n\nScrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple deep green robe,\nor mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the\nfigure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be\nwarded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the\nample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no\nother covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining\nicicles. Its dark-brown curls were long and free; free as its genial\nface, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its\nunconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was\nan antique scabbard: but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was\neaten up with rust.\n\n'You have never seen the like of me before!' exclaimed the Spirit.\n\n'Never,' Scrooge made answer to it.\n\n'Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning\n(for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?'\npursued the Phantom.\n\n'I don't think I have,' said Scrooge.

'I won't believe it.'\n\nHis colour changed, though, when, without a pause, it came on through\nthe heavy door and passed into the room before his eyes. Upon its coming\nin, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, 'I know him! Marley's\nGhost!' and fell again.\n\nThe same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat,\ntights, and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his\npigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he\ndrew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like\na tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes,\nkeys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His\nbody was transparent: so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking\nthrough his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.\n\nScrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had\nnever believed it until now.\n\nNo, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through\nand through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling\ninfluence of its death-cold eyes, and marked the very texture of the\nfolded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not\nobserved before, he was still incredulous, and fought against his\nsenses.\n\n'How now!' said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. 'What do you want\nwith me?'\n\n'Much!'--Marley's voice; no doubt about it.\n\n'Who are you?'\n\n'Ask me who I _was_.'\n\n'Who _were_ you, then?' said Scrooge, raising his voice. 'You're\nparticular, for a shade.' He was going to say '_to_ a shade,' but\nsubstituted this, as more appropriate.\n\n'In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.'\n\n'Can you--can you sit down?' asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him.\n\n'I can.'\n\n'Do it, then.'\n\nScrooge asked the question, because he didn't know whether a ghost so\ntransparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt\nthat in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the\nnecessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the Ghost sat down on the\nopposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.\n\n'You don't believe in me,' observed the Ghost.\n\n'I don't,' said Scrooge.\n\n'What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your own\nsenses?'\n\n'I don't know,' said Scrooge.\n\n'Why do you doubt your senses?'\n\n'Because,' said Scrooge, 'a little thing affects them. A slight disorder\nof the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef,\na blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato.\nThere's more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!'\n\nScrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel in\nhis heart by any means waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be\nsmart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his\nterror; for the spectre's voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones.\n\nTo sit staring at those fixed, glazed eyes in silence, for a moment,\nwould play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him. There was something\nvery awful, too, in the spectre's being provided with an infernal\natmosphere of his own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was\nclearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its\nhair, and skirts, and tassels were still agitated as by the hot vapour\nfrom an oven.\n\n'You see this toothpick?' said Scrooge, returning quickly to the charge,\nfor the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were only for a\nsecond, to divert the vision's stony gaze from himself.\n\n'I do,' replied the Ghost.\n\n'You are not looking at it,' said Scrooge.\n\n'But I see it,' said the Ghost, 'notwithstanding.'\n\n'Well!' returned Scrooge, 'I have but to swallow this, and be for the\nrest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own\ncreation. Humbug, I tell you: humbug!'\n\nAt this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such\na dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his chair,\nto save himself from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was his\nhorror when the phantom, taking off the bandage round his head, as if it\nwere too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its\nbreast!\n\nScrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.\n\n'Mercy!' he said. 'Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?'\n\n'Man of the worldly mind!' replied"}}

At the ominous\nword 'liberality' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the\ncredentials back.\n\n'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,' said the gentleman,\ntaking up a pen, 'it is more than usually desirable that we should make\nsome slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at\nthe present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;\nhundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.'\n\n'Are there no prisons?' asked Scrooge.\n\n'Plenty of prisons,' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\n\n'And the Union workhouses?' demanded Scrooge. 'Are they still in\noperation?'\n\n'They are. Still,' returned the gentleman, 'I wish I could say they were\nnot.'\n\n'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?' said Scrooge.\n\n'Both very busy, sir.'\n\n'Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had\noccurred to stop them in their useful course,' said Scrooge. 'I am very\nglad to hear it.'\n\n'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind\nor body to the multitude,' returned the gentleman, 'a few of us are\nendeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and\nmeans of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all\nothers, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I\nput you down for?'\n\n'Nothing!' Scrooge replied.\n\n'You wish to be anonymous?'\n\n'I wish to be left alone,' said Scrooge. 'Since you ask me what I wish,\ngentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas,\nand I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the\nestablishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are\nbadly off must go there.'\n\n'Many can't go there; and many would rather die.'\n\n'If they would rather die,' said Scrooge, 'they had better do it, and\ndecrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.'\n\n'But you might know it,' observed the gentleman.\n\n'It's not my business,' Scrooge returned. 'It's enough for a man to\nunderstand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's.\nMine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!'\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold.

Show me no\nmore!'\n\nBut the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms, and forced him\nto observe what happened next.\n\nThey were in another scene and place; a room, not very large or\nhandsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful\nyoung girl, so like that last that Scrooge believed it was the same,\nuntil he saw _her_, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter.\nThe noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more\nchildren there than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count;\nand, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not forty\nchildren conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting\nitself like forty. The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but\nno one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed\nheartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to\nmingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most\nruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of them! Though I\nnever could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn't for the wealth of all\nthe world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and for the\nprecious little shoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my soul!\nto save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold\nyoung brood, I couldn't have done it; I should have expected my arm to\nhave grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight again. And\nyet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have\nquestioned her, that she might have opened them; to have looked upon the\nlashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let loose\nwaves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price: in\nshort, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest\nlicense of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its"}}

He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret\neyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters.\nSo he listened for the hour.\n\nTo his great astonishment, the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and\nfrom seven to eight, and regularly up to twelve; then stopped. Twelve!\nIt was past two when he went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must\nhave got into the works. Twelve!\n\nHe touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most preposterous\nclock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve, and stopped.\n\n'Why, it isn't possible,' said Scrooge, 'that I can have slept through a\nwhole day and far into another night. It isn't possible that anything\nhas happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!'\n\nThe idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed, and groped his\nway to the window. He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve\nof his dressing-gown before he could see anything; and could see very\nlittle then. All he could make out was, that it was still very foggy and\nextremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and\nfro, and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been if\nnight had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the world. This\nwas a great relief, because 'Three days after sight of this First of\nExchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his order,' and so forth, would\nhave become a mere United States security if there were no days to count\nby.\n\nScrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought it over\nand over, and could make nothing of it. The more he thought, the more\nperplexed he was; and, the more he endeavoured not to think, the more he\nthought.\n\nMarley's Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved within\nhimself, after mature inquiry that it was all a dream, his mind flew\nback again, like a strong spring released, to its first position, and\npresented the same problem to be worked all through, 'Was it a dream or\nnot?'\n\nScrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three-quarters more,\nwhen he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned him of a\nvisitation when the bell tolled one. He resolved to lie awake until the\nhour was passed; and, considering that he could no more go to sleep than\ngo to heaven, this was, perhaps, the wisest resolution in his power.\n\nThe quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he must\nhave sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock. At length it\nbroke upon his listening ear.\n\n'Ding, dong!'\n\n'A quarter past,' said Scrooge, counting.\n\n'Ding, dong!'\n\n'Half past,' said Scrooge.\n\n'Ding, dong!'\n\n'A quarter to it.' said Scrooge.\n\n'Ding, dong!'\n\n'The hour itself,' said Scrooge triumphantly, 'and nothing else!'\n\nHe spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a deep,\ndull, hollow, melancholy ONE. Light flashed up in the room upon the\ninstant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.\n\nThe curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a hand. Not\nthe curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his back, but those to\nwhich his face was addressed. The curtains of his bed were drawn aside;\nand Scrooge, starting up into a half-recumbent attitude, found himself\nface to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as\nI am now to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.\n\nIt was a strange figure--like a child; yet not so like a child as like\nan old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the\nappearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to a\nchild's proportions. Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its\nback, was white, as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in\nit, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were very long and\nmuscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon strength.\nIts legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper\nmembers, bare. It wore a tunic of the purest white; and round its waist\nwas bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held a\nbranch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular contradiction\nof that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with summer flowers. But\nthe strangest thing about it was, that from the crown of its head there\nsprang a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible; and\nwhich was doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a\ngreat extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.\n\nEven this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness,\nwas _not_ its strangest quality. For, as its belt sparkled and\nglittered, now in one part and now in another, and what was light one\ninstant"}}

The panels shrunk, the windows cracked;\nfragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were\nshown instead; but how all this was brought about Scrooge knew no more\nthan you do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything had\nhappened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had\ngone home for the jolly holidays.\n\nHe was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge\nlooked at the Ghost, and, with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced\nanxiously towards the door.\n\nIt opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting\nin, and, putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him,\naddressed him as her 'dear, dear brother.'\n\n'I have come to bring you home, dear brother!' said the child, clapping\nher tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. 'To bring you home, home,\nhome!'\n\n'Home, little Fan?' returned the boy.\n\n'Yes!' said the child, brimful of glee. 'Home for good and all. Home for\never and ever. Father is so much kinder than he used to be, that home's\nlike heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to\nbed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home;\nand he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring you. And\nyou're to be a man!' said the child, opening her eyes; 'and are never to\ncome back here; but first we're to be together all the Christmas long,\nand have the merriest time in all the world.'\n\n'You are quite a woman, little Fan!' exclaimed the boy.\n\nShe clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but,\nbeing too little laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him.

Then old Fezziwig stood\nout to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top couple, too; with a good stiff\npiece of work cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair of\npartners; people who were not to be trifled with; people who would\ndance, and had no notion of walking.\n\nBut if they had been twice as many--ah! four times--old Fezziwig would\nhave been a match for them, and so would Mrs. Fezziwig. As to _her_, she\nwas worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term. If that's not\nhigh praise, tell me higher, and I'll use it. A positive light appeared\nto issue from Fezziwig's calves. They shone in every part of the dance\nlike moons. You couldn't have predicted, at any given time, what would\nbecome of them next. And when old Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone\nall through the dance; advance and retire, both hands to your partner,\nbow and curtsy, cork-screw, thread-the-needle, and back again to your\nplace: Fezziwig 'cut'--cut so deftly, that he appeared to wink with his\nlegs, and came upon his feet again without a stagger.\n\nWhen the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up. Mr. and Mrs.\nFezziwig took their stations, one on either side the door, and, shaking\nhands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him\nor her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the two\n'prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died\naway, and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a counter\nin the back-shop.\n\nDuring the whole of this time Scrooge had acted like a man out of his\nwits. His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self. He\ncorroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and\nunderwent the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the bright\nfaces of his former self and Dick were turned from them, that he\nremembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full upon\nhim, while the light upon its head burnt very clear.\n\n'A small matter,' said the Ghost, 'to make these silly folks so full of\ngratitude.'\n\n'Small!' echoed Scrooge.\n\nThe Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were\npouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig; and when he had done so,\nsaid:\n\n'Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money:\nthree or four, perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves this praise?'\n\n'It isn't that,' said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking\nunconsciously like his former, not his latter self. 'It isn't that,\nSpirit. He has the power to render us happy or unhappy; to make our\nservice light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. Say that his power\nlies in words and looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it\nis impossible to add and count 'em up: what then? The happiness he gives\nis quite as great as if it cost a fortune.'\n\nHe felt the Spirit's glance, and stopped.\n\n'What is the matter?' asked the Ghost.\n\n'Nothing particular,' said Scrooge.\n\n'Something, I think?' the Ghost insisted.\n\n'No,' said Scrooge, 'no. I should like to be able to say a word or two\nto my clerk just now. That's all.'\n\nHis former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish;\nand Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by side in the open air.\n\n'My time grows short,' observed the Spirit. 'Quick!'\n\nThis was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he could see, but\nit produced an immediate effect. For again Scrooge saw himself. He was\nolder now; a man in the prime of life. His face had not the harsh and\nrigid lines of later years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care\nand avarice. There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye,\nwhich showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of\nthe growing tree would fall.\n\nHe was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning\ndress: in whose eyes there were tears, which sparkled in the light that\nshone out of the Ghost of Christmas Past.\n\n'It matters little,' she said softly. 'To you, very little. Another idol\nhas displaced me; and, if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come\nas I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve.'\n\n'What Idol has displaced you?' he rejoined.\n\n'A golden one.'\n\n'This is the even-handed dealing of the world!' he said. 'There is\nnothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is nothing it\nprofesses to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth!'\n\n'You fear the world too much,' she answered gently. 'All your other\nhopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid\nreproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until\nthe master passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?'\n\n'"}}

'Look here!'\n\nFrom the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject,\nfrightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung\nupon the outside of its garment.\n\n'O Man! look here! Look, look down here!' exclaimed the Ghost.\n\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but\nprostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\nfilled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a\nstale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted\nthem, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat\nenthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no\ndegradation, no perversion of humanity in any grade, through all the\nmysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and\ndread.\n\nScrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he\ntried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves,\nrather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\n\n'Spirit! are they yours?' Scrooge could say no more.\n\n'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they\ncling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This\ngirl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of\nall beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,\nunless the writing be erased. Deny it!' cried the Spirit, stretching out\nhis hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for\nyour factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!'\n\n'Have they no refuge or resource?' cried Scrooge.\n\n'Are there no prisons?' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last\ntime with his own words. 'Are there no workhouses?'\n\nThe bell struck Twelve.\n\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last\nstroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob\nMarley, and, lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and\nhooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.\n\n\nSTAVE FOUR\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST OF THE SPIRITS\n\n\nThe Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near him,\nScrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this\nSpirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\n\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched\nhand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\nsurrounded.\n\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n\n'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said\nScrooge.\n\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n\n'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\nbut will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,\nSpirit?'\n\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\nhe received.\n\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\nrecover.\n\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,\nuncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\nheap of black.\n\n'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre\nI have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope\nto live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your\ncompany, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?'\n\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n\n'Lead on!' said Scrooge. 'Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is\nprecious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!'\n\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in\nthe shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him\nalong.\n\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to\nspring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there they\nwere in the heart of it; on 'Change, amongst the merchants,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Is it a foot or a\nclaw?'\n\n'It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,' was the Spirit's\nsorrowful reply. 'Look here!'\n\nFrom the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject,\nfrightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung\nupon the outside of its garment.\n\n'O Man! look here! Look, look down here!' exclaimed the Ghost.\n\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but\nprostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\nfilled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a\nstale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted\nthem, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat\nenthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no\ndegradation, no perversion of humanity in any grade, through all the\nmysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and\ndread.\n\nScrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he\ntried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves,\nrather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\n\n'Spirit! are they yours?' Scrooge could say no more.\n\n'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they\ncling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This\ngirl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of\nall beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,\nunless the writing be erased. Deny it!' cried the Spirit, stretching out\nhis hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for\nyour factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!'\n\n'Have they no refuge or resource?' cried Scrooge.\n\n'Are there no prisons?' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last\ntime with his own words. 'Are there no workhouses?'\n\nThe bell struck Twelve.\n\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last\nstroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob\nMarley, and, lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and\nhooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.\n\n\nSTAVE FOUR\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST OF THE SPIRITS\n\n\nThe Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near him,\nScrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this\nSpirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\n\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched\nhand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\nsurrounded.\n\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n\n'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said\nScrooge.\n\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n\n'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\nbut will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,\nSpirit?'\n\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\nhe received.\n\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\nrecover.\n\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,\nuncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\nheap of black.\n\n'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre\nI have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope\nto live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your\ncompany, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?'\n\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n\n'Lead on!' said Scrooge. 'Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is\nprecious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!'\n\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in\nthe shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him\nalong.\n\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to\nspring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there they\nwere in the heart of it; on 'Change, amongst the merchants,"}}

Then the shouting and the struggling, and the\nonslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him, with\nchairs for ladders, to dive into his pockets, despoil him of\nbrown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his\nneck, pummel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The\nshouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package\nwas received!

'That they are what they are do not blame me!'\n\n'Remove me!' Scrooge exclaimed, 'I cannot bear it!'\n\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a\nface, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces\nit had shown him, wrestled with it.\n\n'Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!'\n\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost\nwith no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort\nof its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and\nbright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized\nthe extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its\nhead.\n\n[Illustration: _Laden with Christmas toys and presents_]\n\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its\nwhole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he\ncould not hide the light, which streamed from under it, in an unbroken\nflood upon the ground.\n\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible\ndrowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom.

Then the shouting and the struggling, and the\nonslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him, with\nchairs for ladders, to dive into his pockets, despoil him of\nbrown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his\nneck, pummel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The\nshouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package\nwas received! The terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in\nthe act of putting a doll's frying pan into his mouth, and was more than\nsuspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden\nplatter! The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy, and\ngratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike. It is enough\nthat, by degrees, the children and their emotions got out of the\nparlour, and, by one stair at a time, up to the top of the house, where\nthey went to bed, and so subsided.\n\nAnd now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of\nthe house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her\nand her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such\nanother creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have\ncalled him father, and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his\nlife, his sight grew very dim indeed.\n\n'Belle,' said the husband, turning to his wife with a smile, 'I saw an\nold friend of yours this afternoon.'\n\n'Who was it?'\n\n'Guess!'\n\n'How can I? Tut, don't I know?' she added in the same breath, laughing\nas he laughed. 'Mr. Scrooge.'\n\n'Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as it was not shut\nup, and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing him. His\npartner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat alone.\nQuite alone in the world, I do believe.'\n\n'Spirit!' said Scrooge in a broken voice, 'remove me from this place.'\n\n'I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,' said the\nGhost. 'That they are what they are do not blame me!'\n\n'Remove me!' Scrooge exclaimed, 'I cannot bear it!'\n\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a\nface, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces\nit had shown him, wrestled with it.\n\n'Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!'\n\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost\nwith no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort\nof its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and\nbright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized\nthe extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its\nhead.\n\n[Illustration: _Laden with Christmas toys and presents_]\n\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its\nwhole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he\ncould not hide the light, which streamed from under it, in an unbroken\nflood upon the ground.\n\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible\ndrowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a\nparting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel\nto bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nSTAVE THREE\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS\n\n\nAwaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in\nbed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told\nthat the bell was again upon the stroke of One. He felt that he was\nrestored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial\npurpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to\nhim through Jacob Marley's intervention. But finding that he turned\nuncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this\nnew spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own\nhands, and, lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the\nbed. For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\nappearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.\n\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being"}}

'My time is nearly gone.'\n\n'I will,' said Scrooge. 'But don't be hard upon me! Don't be flowery,\nJacob! Pray!'\n\n'How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I may\nnot tell. I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day.'\n\nIt was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered, and wiped the\nperspiration from his brow.\n\n'That is no light part of my penance,' pursued the Ghost. 'I am here\nto-night to warn you that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my\nfate. A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.'\n\n'You were always a good friend to me,' said Scrooge. 'Thankee!'\n\n'You will be haunted,' resumed the Ghost, 'by Three Spirits.'\n\nScrooge's countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost's had done.\n\n'Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob?' he demanded in a\nfaltering voice.\n\n'It is.'\n\n'I--I think I'd rather not,' said Scrooge.\n\n'Without their visits,' said the Ghost, 'you cannot hope to shun the\npath I tread. Expect the first to-morrow when the bell tolls One.'\n\n'Couldn't I take 'em all at once, and have it over, Jacob?' hinted\nScrooge.\n\n'Expect the second on the next night at the same hour. The third, upon\nthe next night when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate.\nLook to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember\nwhat has passed between us!'\n\nWhen it had said these words, the spectre took its wrapper from the\ntable, and bound it round its head as before. Scrooge knew this by the\nsmart sound its teeth made when the jaws were brought together by the\nbandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again, and found his supernatural\nvisitor confronting him in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over\nand about its arm.\n\n[Illustration: _The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and\nthither in restless haste and moaning as they went_]\n\nThe apparition walked backward from him; and, at every step it took, the\nwindow raised itself a little, so that, when the spectre reached it, it\nwas wide open. It beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did. When they\nwere within two paces of each other, Marley's Ghost held up its hand,\nwarning him to come no nearer. Scrooge stopped.\n\nNot so much in obedience as in surprise and fear; for, on the raising of\nthe hand, he became sensible of confused noises in the air; incoherent\nsounds of lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and\nself-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a moment, joined in\nthe mournful dirge; and floated out upon the bleak, dark night.\n\nScrooge followed to the window: desperate in his curiosity. He looked\nout.\n\nThe air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in\nrestless haste, and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains\nlike Marley's Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were\nlinked together; none were free. Many had been personally known to\nScrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost in\na white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who\ncried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an\ninfant, whom it saw below upon a doorstep. The misery with them all was\nclearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and\nhad lost the power for ever.\n\nWhether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he\ncould not tell. But they and their spirit voices faded together; and\nthe night became as it had been when he walked home.\n\nScrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the Ghost had\nentered. It was double locked, as he had locked it with his own hands,\nand the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say 'Humbug!' but stopped at\nthe first syllable. And being, from the emotions he had undergone, or\nthe fatigues of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or the\ndull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of the hour, much in\nneed of repose, went straight to bed without undressing, and fell asleep\nupon the instant.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nSTAVE TWO\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS\n\n\nWhen Scrooge awoke it was so dark, that, looking out of bed, he could\nscarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his\nchamber. He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret\neyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters.\nSo he listened for the hour.\n\nTo his great astonishment, the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and\nfrom seven to eight, and"}}

'Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?'\n\n'Man of the worldly mind!' replied the Ghost, 'do you believe in me or\nnot?'\n\n'I do,' said Scrooge; 'I must. But why do spirits walk the earth, and\nwhy do they come to me?'\n\n'It is required of every man,' the Ghost returned, 'that the spirit\nwithin him should walk abroad among his fellow-men, and travel far and\nwide; and, if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do\nso after death. It is doomed to wander through the world--oh, woe is\nme!--and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth,\nand turned to happiness!'\n\nAgain the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its\nshadowy hands.\n\n'You are fettered,' said Scrooge, trembling. 'Tell me why?'\n\n'I wear the chain I forged in life,' replied the Ghost. 'I made it link\nby link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of\nmy own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to _you_?'\n\nScrooge trembled more and more.\n\n'Or would you know,' pursued the Ghost, 'the weight and length of the\nstrong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this\nseven Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it since. It is a\nponderous chain!'\n\nScrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding\nhimself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable; but he\ncould see nothing.\n\n'Jacob!' he said imploringly. 'Old Jacob Marley, tell me more! Speak\ncomfort to me, Jacob!'\n\n'I have none to give,' the Ghost replied. 'It comes from other regions,\nEbenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of\nmen. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all\npermitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere.\nMy spirit never walked beyond our counting-house--mark me;--in life my\nspirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole;\nand weary journeys lie before me!'\n\nIt was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his\nhands in his breeches pockets. Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he\ndid so now, but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his knees.\n\n[Illustration: ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND]\n\n'You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,' Scrooge observed in a\nbusiness-like manner, though with humility and deference.\n\n'Slow!' the Ghost repeated.\n\n'Seven years dead,' mused Scrooge. 'And travelling all the time?'\n\n'The whole time,' said the Ghost. 'No rest, no peace. Incessant torture\nof remorse.'\n\n'You travel fast?' said Scrooge.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'On the wings of the wind,' replied the Ghost.\n\n'You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years,'\nsaid Scrooge.\n\nThe Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its chain so\nhideously in the dead silence of the night, that the Ward would have\nbeen justified in indicting it for a nuisance.\n\n'Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,' cried the phantom, 'not to know\nthat ages of incessant labour, by immortal creatures, for this earth\nmust pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is\nall developed! Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in\nits little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too\nshort for its vast means of usefulness! Not to know that no space of\nregret can make amends for one life's opportunities misused! Yet such\nwas I! Oh, such was I!'\n\n'But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,' faltered Scrooge,\nwho now began to apply this to himself.\n\n'Business!' cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. 'Mankind was my\nbusiness. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy,\nforbearance, and benevolence were, all, my business. The dealings of my\ntrade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my\nbusiness!'\n\nIt held up its chain at arm's-length, as if that were the cause of all\nits unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.\n\n'At this time of the rolling year,' the spectre said, 'I suffer most.\nWhy did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down,\nand never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a\npoor abode? Were there no poor homes to which its light would have\nconducted _me_?'\n\nScrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this\nrate, and began to quake exceedingly.\n\n'Hear me!' cried the Ghost. 'My time is nearly gone.'\n\n'I will,' said Scrooge. 'But don't be hard"}}

The poulterers' shops were still half open,\nand the fruiterers' were radiant in their glory. There were great,\nround, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats of\njolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out into the\nstreet in their apoplectic opulence: There were ruddy, brown-faced,\nbroad-girthed Spanish onions, shining in the fatness of their growth\nlike Spanish friars, and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at\nthe girls as they went by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up\nmistletoe. There were pears and apples clustered high in blooming\npyramids; there were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers'\nbenevolence, to dangle from conspicuous hooks that people's mouths might\nwater gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy and\nbrown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among the woods, and\npleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves; there were\nNorfolk Biffins, squab and swarthy, setting off the yellow of the\noranges and lemons, and, in the great compactness of their juicy\npersons, urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper\nbags and eaten after dinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth\namong these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and\nstagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was something going\non; and, to a fish, went gasping round and round their little world in\nslow and passionless excitement.\n\nThe Grocers'! oh, the Grocers'! nearly closed, with perhaps two shutters\ndown, or one; but through those gaps such glimpses!

Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them? Why\ndid his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past? Why\nwas he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry\nChristmas, as they parted at cross-roads and by-ways for their several\nhomes? What was merry Christmas to Scrooge? Out upon merry Christmas!\nWhat good had it ever done to him?\n\n'The school is not quite deserted,' said the Ghost. 'A solitary child,\nneglected by his friends, is left there still.'\n\nScrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.\n\nThey left the high-road by a well-remembered lane and soon approached a\nmansion of dull red brick, with a little weather-cock surmounted cupola\non the roof, and a bell hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of\nbroken fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls\nwere damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed.\nFowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-houses and\nsheds were overrun with grass. Nor was it more retentive of its ancient\nstate within; for, entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the\nopen doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and\nvast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a chilly bareness in the\nplace, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by\ncandle light and not too much to eat.\n\nThey went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back\nof the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare,\nmelancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and\ndesks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and\nScrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as\nhe had used to be.\n\nNot a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice\nbehind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed waterspout in the\ndull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent\npoplar, not the idle swinging of an empty storehouse door, no, not a\nclicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with softening\ninfluence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.\n\nThe Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger self,\nintent upon his reading. Suddenly a man in foreign garments, wonderfully\nreal and distinct to look at, stood outside the window, with an axe\nstuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.\n\n'Why, it's Ali Baba!' Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. 'It's dear old\nhonest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know. One Christmas-time, when yonder\nsolitary child was left here all alone, he _did_ come, for the first\ntime, just like that. Poor boy! And Valentine,' said Scrooge, 'and his\nwild brother, Orson; there they go! And what's his name, who was put\ndown in his drawers, asleep, at the gate of Damascus; don't you see him?\nAnd the Sultan's Groom turned upside down by the Genii; there he is upon\nhis head! Serve him right! I'm glad of it. What business had he to be\nmarried to the Princess?'\n\nTo hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such\nsubjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and\nto see his heightened and excited face; would have been a surprise to\nhis business friends in the City, indeed.\n\n'There's the Parrot!' cried Scrooge.

He is characterized by his disdain for Christmas and merriment, his resistance to social interaction, and his lack of generosity, particularly towards his clerk and in the spirit of the Christmas season. As Marley's business partner and a man deeply entrenched in his ways of business, Scrooge's life is marked by isolation and a practical, albeit skeptical, approach to life, including a disbelief in the supernatural despite eerie encounters, such as seeing Marley's face on his door knocker.\n\nHowever, Scrooge's character undergoes a profound transformation through a series of supernatural visits that begin on Christmas Eve. Guided by the Ghost of Christmas Past, he is shown scenes from his own life that stir deep emotions and reflections on his actions and attitudes. His interactions with the Spirit of Christmas Present further reveal his curiosity and skepticism, yet he begins to show signs of emotional response and regret for his past behaviors. The visitation by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, showing him visions of his own grave and the aftermath of a man's death, prompts a moment of intense realization and a desperate plea for the chance to change his fate.\n\nThis journey through his past, present, and potential future leads Scrooge to experience a range of emotions, from horror and regret to a newfound sense of joy and generosity. Witnessing scenes of Christmas cheer, participating in games, and observing the Cratchit family indirectly, Scrooge comes to understand the implications of his own life choices. On Christmas Day, he embodies his transformation by buying a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engaging positively with people on the streets, showing a marked change in mood and behavior.\n\nUltimately, Scrooge's transformation is central to the narrative, affecting not only his own life but also those around him, including his clerk's family and his nephew. He becomes a better friend, master, and man, known for keeping Christmas well and for his significant change of heart. Scrooge's story is a testament to the possibility of redemption and the profound impact of reflection, empathy, and the willingness to embrace change.\",52\n23,\"\"\"SCROOGE'S NEPHEW\"\"\",\"Scrooge's nephew, Fred, is the embodiment of the Christmas spirit, contrasting sharply with his uncle Scrooge's skepticism and isolation.

Fred's involvement in a game of Yes and No, which leads to a revelation that the answer is his uncle Scrooge, further highlights his persistent attempts to connect with and understand his uncle.

He is characterized by his disdain for Christmas and merriment, his resistance to social interaction, and his lack of generosity, particularly towards his clerk and in the spirit of the Christmas season. As Marley's business partner and a man deeply entrenched in his ways of business, Scrooge's life is marked by isolation and a practical, albeit skeptical, approach to life, including a disbelief in the supernatural despite eerie encounters, such as seeing Marley's face on his door knocker.\n\nHowever, Scrooge's character undergoes a profound transformation through a series of supernatural visits that begin on Christmas Eve. Guided by the Ghost of Christmas Past, he is shown scenes from his own life that stir deep emotions and reflections on his actions and attitudes. His interactions with the Spirit of Christmas Present further reveal his curiosity and skepticism, yet he begins to show signs of emotional response and regret for his past behaviors. The visitation by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, showing him visions of his own grave and the aftermath of a man's death, prompts a moment of intense realization and a desperate plea for the chance to change his fate.\n\nThis journey through his past, present, and potential future leads Scrooge to experience a range of emotions, from horror and regret to a newfound sense of joy and generosity. Witnessing scenes of Christmas cheer, participating in games, and observing the Cratchit family indirectly, Scrooge comes to understand the implications of his own life choices. On Christmas Day, he embodies his transformation by buying a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engaging positively with people on the streets, showing a marked change in mood and behavior.\n\nUltimately, Scrooge's transformation is central to the narrative, affecting not only his own life but also those around him, including his clerk's family and his nephew. He becomes a better friend, master, and man, known for keeping Christmas well and for his significant change of heart. Scrooge's story is a testament to the possibility of redemption and the profound impact of reflection, empathy, and the willingness to embrace change.\",52\n23,\"\"\"SCROOGE'S NEPHEW\"\"\",\"Scrooge's nephew, Fred, is the embodiment of the Christmas spirit, contrasting sharply with his uncle Scrooge's skepticism and isolation. Fred is characterized by his cheerful, optimistic nature, and his persistent efforts to share the joy and merriment of the holiday season with Scrooge. He is depicted as a jovial and optimistic character, who not only encourages merriment but also expresses pity for his uncle's bitterness and isolation, especially during Christmas. Fred's involvement in a game of Yes and No, which leads to a revelation that the answer is his uncle Scrooge, further highlights his persistent attempts to connect with and understand his uncle.

This transformation is most evident in his actions following his epiphany; Scrooge becomes a second father to Tiny Tim, showcasing a deep, familial bond forged through his newfound generosity. His consideration for Tiny Tim's well-being is further highlighted by his reference to the size of the turkey he provides, ensuring it is ample for Tim and his family.

He is characterized by his disdain for Christmas and merriment, his resistance to social interaction, and his lack of generosity, particularly towards his clerk and in the spirit of the Christmas season. As Marley's business partner and a man deeply entrenched in his ways of business, Scrooge's life is marked by isolation and a practical, albeit skeptical, approach to life, including a disbelief in the supernatural despite eerie encounters, such as seeing Marley's face on his door knocker.\n\nHowever, Scrooge's character undergoes a profound transformation through a series of supernatural visits that begin on Christmas Eve. Guided by the Ghost of Christmas Past, he is shown scenes from his own life that stir deep emotions and reflections on his actions and attitudes. His interactions with the Spirit of Christmas Present further reveal his curiosity and skepticism, yet he begins to show signs of emotional response and regret for his past behaviors. The visitation by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, showing him visions of his own grave and the aftermath of a man's death, prompts a moment of intense realization and a desperate plea for the chance to change his fate.\n\nThis journey through his past, present, and potential future leads Scrooge to experience a range of emotions, from horror and regret to a newfound sense of joy and generosity. Witnessing scenes of Christmas cheer, participating in games, and observing the Cratchit family indirectly, Scrooge comes to understand the implications of his own life choices. On Christmas Day, he embodies his transformation by buying a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engaging positively with people on the streets, showing a marked change in mood and behavior.\n\nUltimately, Scrooge's transformation is central to the narrative, affecting not only his own life but also those around him, including his clerk's family and his nephew. He becomes a better friend, master, and man, known for keeping Christmas well and for his significant change of heart. Scrooge's story is a testament to the possibility of redemption and the profound impact of reflection, empathy, and the willingness to embrace change.\",52\n23,\"\"\"SCROOGE'S NEPHEW\"\"\",\"Scrooge's nephew, Fred, is the embodiment of the Christmas spirit, contrasting sharply with his uncle Scrooge's skepticism and isolation.

Fred's involvement in a game of Yes and No, which leads to a revelation that the answer is his uncle Scrooge, further highlights his persistent attempts to connect with and understand his uncle.

This change in character is evidenced by his decision to send a large turkey to Bob Cratchit as a surprise Christmas gift, symbolizing his newfound generosity.

His negative views and attitudes towards Christmas highlight his isolation and miserliness, setting the stage for his journey of self-discovery and change. This journey is facilitated by his experiences with the Ghost, which are central to the narrative and deeply tied to understanding and embracing the true meaning of Christmas. Through these experiences, Scrooge's change of heart and actions become centered around the Christmas holiday, demonstrating a deep connection between his transformation and the event.

This transformation is most evident in his actions following his epiphany; Scrooge becomes a second father to Tiny Tim, showcasing a deep, familial bond forged through his newfound generosity. His consideration for Tiny Tim's well-being is further highlighted by his reference to the size of the turkey he provides, ensuring it is ample for Tim and his family.

Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\n19,\"\"\"SCROOGE\"\"\",\"Scrooge is depicted as the central character of the narrative, initially known for his miserly, cynical, and solitary nature. He is characterized by his disdain for Christmas and merriment, his resistance to social interaction, and his lack of generosity, particularly towards his clerk and in the spirit of the Christmas season. As Marley's business partner and a man deeply entrenched in his ways of business, Scrooge's life is marked by isolation and a practical, albeit skeptical, approach to life, including a disbelief in the supernatural despite eerie encounters, such as seeing Marley's face on his door knocker.\n\nHowever, Scrooge's character undergoes a profound transformation through a series of supernatural visits that begin on Christmas Eve. Guided by the Ghost of Christmas Past, he is shown scenes from his own life that stir deep emotions and reflections on his actions and attitudes. His interactions with the Spirit of Christmas Present further reveal his curiosity and skepticism, yet he begins to show signs of emotional response and regret for his past behaviors. The visitation by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, showing him visions of his own grave and the aftermath of a man's death, prompts a moment of intense realization and a desperate plea for the chance to change his fate.\n\nThis journey through his past, present, and potential future leads Scrooge to experience a range of emotions, from horror and regret to a newfound sense of joy and generosity. Witnessing scenes of Christmas cheer, participating in games, and observing the Cratchit family indirectly, Scrooge comes to understand the implications of his own life choices. On Christmas Day, he embodies his transformation by buying a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engaging positively with people on the streets, showing a marked change in mood and behavior.\n\nUltimately, Scrooge's transformation is central to the narrative, affecting not only his own life but also those around him, including his clerk's family and his nephew. He becomes a better friend, master, and man, known for keeping Christmas well and for his significant change of heart. Scrooge's story is a testament to the possibility of redemption and the profound impact of reflection, empathy, and the willingness to embrace change.\",52\n9,\"\"\"TINY TIM\"\"\",\"Tiny Tim, the youngest son of Bob Cratchit, is a central figure in \"\"A Christmas Carol,\"\" whose health condition and future are of significant concern to his family and pivotal to the narrative. He is portrayed as a symbol of the Cratchit family's struggles and love, embodying hope amidst adversity. Tiny Tim's physical frailty contrasts with his optimistic and thoughtful nature, making him a memorable and endearing character. His significance extends beyond his family, influencing Ebenezer Scrooge's transformation. Through conversations with a Ghost and Scrooge, Tiny Tim's situation is highlighted, underscoring his importance in the story and to Scrooge's eventual change of heart. Despite his small stature, indicated in a comparison to the size of a turkey, Tiny Tim's spirit and memory have a profound impact on those around him, including Scrooge, who comes to regard him as a second father. Remembered by the Cratchit family as a mild and patient child, Tiny Tim does not succumb to his ailments, benefiting from Scrooge's newfound generosity and compassion. His story is a powerful testament to the themes of hope and redemption that are central to \"\"A Christmas Carol.\"\"\",5\n55,\"\"\"CHRISTMAS DAY\"\"\",\"Christmas Day is a pivotal and significant event within the story, serving as the setting for the story's climax and bringing the Cratchit family together. It is a time that highlights their love, hope, and unity despite hardship, through the traditions of toasts and a shared meal. Moreover, Christmas Day represents hope, joy, and the opportunity for transformation, particularly for Scrooge. It is on this day that Scrooge realizes he hasn't missed the chance to change his ways and acts on his new outlook, embracing the spirit of Christmas. This day is crucial in demonstrating the potential for redemption and the importance of family and kindness in the narrative.\",3\n11,\"\"\"GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST\"\"\",\"The Ghost of Christmas Past is a spectral figure that visits Scrooge to show him scenes from his past. This phantom aims to prompt Scrooge to reflect on his life choices and the impact they have had on himself and others. By presenting these vivid recollections, the spirit seeks to encourage Scrooge to consider the path his life has taken and the potential for change. This encounter is characterized by the ghost's ability to transport Scrooge back in time, allowing him to witness firsthand the moments that have shaped his current disposition and outlook on life.\",3\n23,\"\"\"SCROOGE'S NEPHEW\"\"\",\"Scrooge's nephew, Fred, is the embodiment of the Christmas spirit, contrasting sharply with his uncle Scrooge's skepticism and isolation. Fred is characterized by his cheerful, optimistic nature, and his persistent efforts to share the joy and merriment of the holiday season with Scrooge. He is depicted as a jovial and optimistic character, who not only encourages merriment but also expresses pity for his uncle's bitterness and isolation, especially during Christmas. Fred's involvement in a game of Yes and No, which leads to a revelation that the answer is his uncle Scrooge, further highlights his persistent attempts to connect with and understand his uncle. Through his actions and outlook, Fred serves as a stark contrast to Scrooge, embodying the spirit of Christmas and the potential for change and goodwill towards others.\",2\n25,\"\"\"THE CITY\"\"\",\"The City, as depicted in the narrative, refers to the unspecified urban setting, likely London, where characters such as Scrooge, Bob Cratchit, and Tiny Tim reside. It symbolizes the broader societal context of the story, encapsulating the cold, bleak, and foggy environment that sets a somber tone for the narrative. This setting is crucial as it not only houses Scrooge's counting-house but also vanishes as Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Past travel back in time to his childhood. The City, therefore, serves as a backdrop that reflects the harsh realities of the time and underscores the personal transformation journey of Scrooge.\",2\n76,\"\"\"CHANGE\"\"\",\"\"\"'Change refers to the Royal Exchange in London, a central location for merchants and businessmen where Scrooge and the Phantom observe a conversation.\"\"\",1\n73,\"\"\"CITY\"\"\",\"\"\"The City is where Scrooge and the Phantom find themselves among merchants and business men, indicating its bustling economic activity.\"\"\",1\n26,\"\"\"COUNTING-HOUSE\"\"\",,1\n86,\"\"\"DEATH\"\"\",\"\"\"Death is personified in the text as a pivotal event that catalyzes change and reflection in Scrooge's character.\"\"\",1\n41,\"\"\"EXTINGUISHER\"\"\",,1\n74,\"\"\"JACOB\"\"\",\"\"\"Jacob is mentioned as Scrooge's old partner, whose death is discussed among the businessmen, suggesting his past significance to Scrooge.\"\"\",1\n101,\"\"\"JOE MILLER\"\"\",,1\n32,\"\"\"LONDON\"\"\",\"London is depicted as a significant setting within the narrative, indirectly referenced through the mention of the City of London, which represents the broader economic and social environment of the story.

Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\n19,\"\"\"SCROOGE\"\"\",\"Scrooge is depicted as the central character of the narrative, initially known for his miserly, cynical, and solitary nature. He is characterized by his disdain for Christmas and merriment, his resistance to social interaction, and his lack of generosity, particularly towards his clerk and in the spirit of the Christmas season. As Marley's business partner and a man deeply entrenched in his ways of business, Scrooge's life is marked by isolation and a practical, albeit skeptical, approach to life, including a disbelief in the supernatural despite eerie encounters, such as seeing Marley's face on his door knocker.\n\nHowever, Scrooge's character undergoes a profound transformation through a series of supernatural visits that begin on Christmas Eve. Guided by the Ghost of Christmas Past, he is shown scenes from his own life that stir deep emotions and reflections on his actions and attitudes. His interactions with the Spirit of Christmas Present further reveal his curiosity and skepticism, yet he begins to show signs of emotional response and regret for his past behaviors. The visitation by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, showing him visions of his own grave and the aftermath of a man's death, prompts a moment of intense realization and a desperate plea for the chance to change his fate.\n\nThis journey through his past, present, and potential future leads Scrooge to experience a range of emotions, from horror and regret to a newfound sense of joy and generosity. Witnessing scenes of Christmas cheer, participating in games, and observing the Cratchit family indirectly, Scrooge comes to understand the implications of his own life choices. On Christmas Day, he embodies his transformation by buying a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engaging positively with people on the streets, showing a marked change in mood and behavior.\n\nUltimately, Scrooge's transformation is central to the narrative, affecting not only his own life but also those around him, including his clerk's family and his nephew. He becomes a better friend, master, and man, known for keeping Christmas well and for his significant change of heart. Scrooge's story is a testament to the possibility of redemption and the profound impact of reflection, empathy, and the willingness to embrace change.\",52\n9,\"\"\"TINY TIM\"\"\",\"Tiny Tim, the youngest son of Bob Cratchit, is a central figure in \"\"A Christmas Carol,\"\" whose health condition and future are of significant concern to his family and pivotal to the narrative. He is portrayed as a symbol of the Cratchit family's struggles and love, embodying hope amidst adversity. Tiny Tim's physical frailty contrasts with his optimistic and thoughtful nature, making him a memorable and endearing character. His significance extends beyond his family, influencing Ebenezer Scrooge's transformation. Through conversations with a Ghost and Scrooge, Tiny Tim's situation is highlighted, underscoring his importance in the story and to Scrooge's eventual change of heart. Despite his small stature, indicated in a comparison to the size of a turkey, Tiny Tim's spirit and memory have a profound impact on those around him, including Scrooge, who comes to regard him as a second father. Remembered by the Cratchit family as a mild and patient child, Tiny Tim does not succumb to his ailments, benefiting from Scrooge's newfound generosity and compassion.

Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\n19,\"\"\"SCROOGE\"\"\",\"Scrooge is depicted as the central character of the narrative, initially known for his miserly, cynical, and solitary nature. He is characterized by his disdain for Christmas and merriment, his resistance to social interaction, and his lack of generosity, particularly towards his clerk and in the spirit of the Christmas season. As Marley's business partner and a man deeply entrenched in his ways of business, Scrooge's life is marked by isolation and a practical, albeit skeptical, approach to life, including a disbelief in the supernatural despite eerie encounters, such as seeing Marley's face on his door knocker.\n\nHowever, Scrooge's character undergoes a profound transformation through a series of supernatural visits that begin on Christmas Eve. Guided by the Ghost of Christmas Past, he is shown scenes from his own life that stir deep emotions and reflections on his actions and attitudes. His interactions with the Spirit of Christmas Present further reveal his curiosity and skepticism, yet he begins to show signs of emotional response and regret for his past behaviors. The visitation by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, showing him visions of his own grave and the aftermath of a man's death, prompts a moment of intense realization and a desperate plea for the chance to change his fate.\n\nThis journey through his past, present, and potential future leads Scrooge to experience a range of emotions, from horror and regret to a newfound sense of joy and generosity. Witnessing scenes of Christmas cheer, participating in games, and observing the Cratchit family indirectly, Scrooge comes to understand the implications of his own life choices. On Christmas Day, he embodies his transformation by buying a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engaging positively with people on the streets, showing a marked change in mood and behavior.\n\nUltimately, Scrooge's transformation is central to the narrative, affecting not only his own life but also those around him, including his clerk's family and his nephew. He becomes a better friend, master, and man, known for keeping Christmas well and for his significant change of heart. Scrooge's story is a testament to the possibility of redemption and the profound impact of reflection, empathy, and the willingness to embrace change.\",52\n9,\"\"\"TINY TIM\"\"\",\"Tiny Tim, the youngest son of Bob Cratchit, is a central figure in \"\"A Christmas Carol,\"\" whose health condition and future are of significant concern to his family and pivotal to the narrative. He is portrayed as a symbol of the Cratchit family's struggles and love, embodying hope amidst adversity. Tiny Tim's physical frailty contrasts with his optimistic and thoughtful nature, making him a memorable and endearing character. His significance extends beyond his family, influencing Ebenezer Scrooge's transformation. Through conversations with a Ghost and Scrooge, Tiny Tim's situation is highlighted, underscoring his importance in the story and to Scrooge's eventual change of heart. Despite his small stature, indicated in a comparison to the size of a turkey, Tiny Tim's spirit and memory have a profound impact on those around him, including Scrooge, who comes to regard him as a second father. Remembered by the Cratchit family as a mild and patient child, Tiny Tim does not succumb to his ailments, benefiting from Scrooge's newfound generosity and compassion. His story is a powerful testament to the themes of hope and redemption that are central to \"\"A Christmas Carol.\"\"\",5\n55,\"\"\"CHRISTMAS DAY\"\"\",\"Christmas Day is a pivotal and significant event within the story, serving as the setting for the story's climax and bringing the Cratchit family together. It is a time that highlights their love, hope, and unity despite hardship, through the traditions of toasts and a shared meal. Moreover, Christmas Day represents hope, joy, and the opportunity for transformation, particularly for Scrooge. It is on this day that Scrooge realizes he hasn't missed the chance to change his ways and acts on his new outlook, embracing the spirit of Christmas. This day is crucial in demonstrating the potential for redemption and the importance of family and kindness in the narrative.\",3\n11,\"\"\"GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST\"\"\",\"The Ghost of Christmas Past is a spectral figure that visits Scrooge to show him scenes from his past.

He is characterized by his disdain for Christmas and merriment, his resistance to social interaction, and his lack of generosity, particularly towards his clerk and in the spirit of the Christmas season. As Marley's business partner and a man deeply entrenched in his ways of business, Scrooge's life is marked by isolation and a practical, albeit skeptical, approach to life, including a disbelief in the supernatural despite eerie encounters, such as seeing Marley's face on his door knocker.\n\nHowever, Scrooge's character undergoes a profound transformation through a series of supernatural visits that begin on Christmas Eve. Guided by the Ghost of Christmas Past, he is shown scenes from his own life that stir deep emotions and reflections on his actions and attitudes. His interactions with the Spirit of Christmas Present further reveal his curiosity and skepticism, yet he begins to show signs of emotional response and regret for his past behaviors. The visitation by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, showing him visions of his own grave and the aftermath of a man's death, prompts a moment of intense realization and a desperate plea for the chance to change his fate.\n\nThis journey through his past, present, and potential future leads Scrooge to experience a range of emotions, from horror and regret to a newfound sense of joy and generosity. Witnessing scenes of Christmas cheer, participating in games, and observing the Cratchit family indirectly, Scrooge comes to understand the implications of his own life choices. On Christmas Day, he embodies his transformation by buying a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engaging positively with people on the streets, showing a marked change in mood and behavior.\n\nUltimately, Scrooge's transformation is central to the narrative, affecting not only his own life but also those around him, including his clerk's family and his nephew. He becomes a better friend, master, and man, known for keeping Christmas well and for his significant change of heart. Scrooge's story is a testament to the possibility of redemption and the profound impact of reflection, empathy, and the willingness to embrace change.\",52\n9,\"\"\"TINY TIM\"\"\",\"Tiny Tim, the youngest son of Bob Cratchit, is a central figure in \"\"A Christmas Carol,\"\" whose health condition and future are of significant concern to his family and pivotal to the narrative. He is portrayed as a symbol of the Cratchit family's struggles and love, embodying hope amidst adversity. Tiny Tim's physical frailty contrasts with his optimistic and thoughtful nature, making him a memorable and endearing character. His significance extends beyond his family, influencing Ebenezer Scrooge's transformation. Through conversations with a Ghost and Scrooge, Tiny Tim's situation is highlighted, underscoring his importance in the story and to Scrooge's eventual change of heart. Despite his small stature, indicated in a comparison to the size of a turkey, Tiny Tim's spirit and memory have a profound impact on those around him, including Scrooge, who comes to regard him as a second father. Remembered by the Cratchit family as a mild and patient child, Tiny Tim does not succumb to his ailments, benefiting from Scrooge's newfound generosity and compassion. His story is a powerful testament to the themes of hope and redemption that are central to \"\"A Christmas Carol.\"\"\",5\n55,\"\"\"CHRISTMAS DAY\"\"\",\"Christmas Day is a pivotal and significant event within the story, serving as the setting for the story's climax and bringing the Cratchit family together. It is a time that highlights their love, hope, and unity despite hardship, through the traditions of toasts and a shared meal. Moreover, Christmas Day represents hope, joy, and the opportunity for transformation, particularly for Scrooge. It is on this day that Scrooge realizes he hasn't missed the chance to change his ways and acts on his new outlook, embracing the spirit of Christmas. This day is crucial in demonstrating the potential for redemption and the importance of family and kindness in the narrative.\",3\n11,\"\"\"GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST\"\"\",\"The Ghost of Christmas Past is a spectral figure that visits Scrooge to show him scenes from his past. This phantom aims to prompt Scrooge to reflect on his life choices and the impact they have had on himself and others. By presenting these vivid recollections, the spirit seeks to encourage Scrooge to consider the path his life has taken and the potential for change. This encounter is characterized by the ghost's ability to transport Scrooge back in time, allowing him to witness firsthand the moments that have shaped his current disposition and outlook on life.\",3\n23,\"\"\"SCROOGE'S NEPHEW\"\"\",\"Scrooge's nephew, Fred, is the embodiment of the Christmas spirit, contrasting sharply with his uncle Scrooge's skepticism and isolation. Fred is characterized by his cheerful, optimistic nature, and his persistent efforts to share the joy and merriment of the holiday season with Scrooge. He is depicted as a jovial and optimistic character, who not only encourages merriment but also expresses pity for his uncle's bitterness and isolation, especially during Christmas. Fred's involvement in a game of Yes and No, which leads to a revelation that the answer is his uncle Scrooge, further highlights his persistent attempts to connect with and understand his uncle. Through his actions and outlook, Fred serves as a stark contrast to Scrooge, embodying the spirit of Christmas and the potential for change and goodwill towards others.\",2\n25,\"\"\"THE CITY\"\"\",\"The City, as depicted in the narrative, refers to the unspecified urban setting, likely London, where characters such as Scrooge, Bob Cratchit, and Tiny Tim reside. It symbolizes the broader societal context of the story, encapsulating the cold, bleak, and foggy environment that sets a somber tone for the narrative. This setting is crucial as it not only houses Scrooge's counting-house but also vanishes as Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Past travel back in time to his childhood. The City, therefore, serves as a backdrop that reflects the harsh realities of the time and underscores the personal transformation journey of Scrooge.\",2\n76,\"\"\"CHANGE\"\"\",\"\"\"'Change refers to the Royal Exchange in London, a central location for merchants and businessmen where Scrooge and the Phantom observe a conversation.\"\"\",1\n73,\"\"\"CITY\"\"\",\"\"\"The City is where Scrooge and the Phantom find themselves among merchants and business men, indicating its bustling economic activity.\"\"\",1\n26,\"\"\"COUNTING-HOUSE\"\"\",,1\n86,\"\"\"DEATH\"\"\",\"\"\"Death is personified in the text as a pivotal event that catalyzes change and reflection in Scrooge's character.\"\"\",1\n41,\"\"\"EXTINGUISHER\"\"\",,1\n74,\"\"\"JACOB\"\"\",\"\"\"Jacob is mentioned as Scrooge's old partner, whose death is discussed among the businessmen, suggesting his past significance to Scrooge.\"\"\",1\n101,\"\"\"JOE MILLER\"\"\",,1\n32,\"\"\"LONDON\"\"\",\"London is depicted as a significant setting within the narrative, indirectly referenced through the mention of the City of London, which represents the broader economic and social environment of the story.

He is characterized by his disdain for Christmas and merriment, his resistance to social interaction, and his lack of generosity, particularly towards his clerk and in the spirit of the Christmas season. As Marley's business partner and a man deeply entrenched in his ways of business, Scrooge's life is marked by isolation and a practical, albeit skeptical, approach to life, including a disbelief in the supernatural despite eerie encounters, such as seeing Marley's face on his door knocker.\n\nHowever, Scrooge's character undergoes a profound transformation through a series of supernatural visits that begin on Christmas Eve. Guided by the Ghost of Christmas Past, he is shown scenes from his own life that stir deep emotions and reflections on his actions and attitudes. His interactions with the Spirit of Christmas Present further reveal his curiosity and skepticism, yet he begins to show signs of emotional response and regret for his past behaviors. The visitation by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, showing him visions of his own grave and the aftermath of a man's death, prompts a moment of intense realization and a desperate plea for the chance to change his fate.\n\nThis journey through his past, present, and potential future leads Scrooge to experience a range of emotions, from horror and regret to a newfound sense of joy and generosity. Witnessing scenes of Christmas cheer, participating in games, and observing the Cratchit family indirectly, Scrooge comes to understand the implications of his own life choices. On Christmas Day, he embodies his transformation by buying a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engaging positively with people on the streets, showing a marked change in mood and behavior.\n\nUltimately, Scrooge's transformation is central to the narrative, affecting not only his own life but also those around him, including his clerk's family and his nephew. He becomes a better friend, master, and man, known for keeping Christmas well and for his significant change of heart. Scrooge's story is a testament to the possibility of redemption and the profound impact of reflection, empathy, and the willingness to embrace change.\",52\n9,\"\"\"TINY TIM\"\"\",\"Tiny Tim, the youngest son of Bob Cratchit, is a central figure in \"\"A Christmas Carol,\"\" whose health condition and future are of significant concern to his family and pivotal to the narrative. He is portrayed as a symbol of the Cratchit family's struggles and love, embodying hope amidst adversity. Tiny Tim's physical frailty contrasts with his optimistic and thoughtful nature, making him a memorable and endearing character. His significance extends beyond his family, influencing Ebenezer Scrooge's transformation. Through conversations with a Ghost and Scrooge, Tiny Tim's situation is highlighted, underscoring his importance in the story and to Scrooge's eventual change of heart. Despite his small stature, indicated in a comparison to the size of a turkey, Tiny Tim's spirit and memory have a profound impact on those around him, including Scrooge, who comes to regard him as a second father. Remembered by the Cratchit family as a mild and patient child, Tiny Tim does not succumb to his ailments, benefiting from Scrooge's newfound generosity and compassion. His story is a powerful testament to the themes of hope and redemption that are central to \"\"A Christmas Carol.\"\"\",5\n55,\"\"\"CHRISTMAS DAY\"\"\",\"Christmas Day is a pivotal and significant event within the story, serving as the setting for the story's climax and bringing the Cratchit family together. It is a time that highlights their love, hope, and unity despite hardship, through the traditions of toasts and a shared meal. Moreover, Christmas Day represents hope, joy, and the opportunity for transformation, particularly for Scrooge. It is on this day that Scrooge realizes he hasn't missed the chance to change his ways and acts on his new outlook, embracing the spirit of Christmas. This day is crucial in demonstrating the potential for redemption and the importance of family and kindness in the narrative.\",3\n11,\"\"\"GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST\"\"\",\"The Ghost of Christmas Past is a spectral figure that visits Scrooge to show him scenes from his past. This phantom aims to prompt Scrooge to reflect on his life choices and the impact they have had on himself and others. By presenting these vivid recollections, the spirit seeks to encourage Scrooge to consider the path his life has taken and the potential for change. This encounter is characterized by the ghost's ability to transport Scrooge back in time, allowing him to witness firsthand the moments that have shaped his current disposition and outlook on life.\",3\n23,\"\"\"SCROOGE'S NEPHEW\"\"\",\"Scrooge's nephew, Fred, is the embodiment of the Christmas spirit, contrasting sharply with his uncle Scrooge's skepticism and isolation. Fred is characterized by his cheerful, optimistic nature, and his persistent efforts to share the joy and merriment of the holiday season with Scrooge. He is depicted as a jovial and optimistic character, who not only encourages merriment but also expresses pity for his uncle's bitterness and isolation, especially during Christmas. Fred's involvement in a game of Yes and No, which leads to a revelation that the answer is his uncle Scrooge, further highlights his persistent attempts to connect with and understand his uncle. Through his actions and outlook, Fred serves as a stark contrast to Scrooge, embodying the spirit of Christmas and the potential for change and goodwill towards others.\",2\n25,\"\"\"THE CITY\"\"\",\"The City, as depicted in the narrative, refers to the unspecified urban setting, likely London, where characters such as Scrooge, Bob Cratchit, and Tiny Tim reside. It symbolizes the broader societal context of the story, encapsulating the cold, bleak, and foggy environment that sets a somber tone for the narrative. This setting is crucial as it not only houses Scrooge's counting-house but also vanishes as Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Past travel back in time to his childhood. The City, therefore, serves as a backdrop that reflects the harsh realities of the time and underscores the personal transformation journey of Scrooge.\",2\n76,\"\"\"CHANGE\"\"\",\"\"\"'Change refers to the Royal Exchange in London, a central location for merchants and businessmen where Scrooge and the Phantom observe a conversation.\"\"\",1\n73,\"\"\"CITY\"\"\",\"\"\"The City is where Scrooge and the Phantom find themselves among merchants and business men, indicating its bustling economic activity.\"\"\",1\n26,\"\"\"COUNTING-HOUSE\"\"\",,1\n86,\"\"\"DEATH\"\"\",\"\"\"Death is personified in the text as a pivotal event that catalyzes change and reflection in Scrooge's character.\"\"\",1\n41,\"\"\"EXTINGUISHER\"\"\",,1\n74,\"\"\"JACOB\"\"\",\"\"\"Jacob is mentioned as Scrooge's old partner, whose death is discussed among the businessmen, suggesting his past significance to Scrooge.\"\"\",1\n101,\"\"\"JOE MILLER\"\"\",,1\n32,\"\"\"LONDON\"\"\",\"London is depicted as a significant setting within the narrative, indirectly referenced through the mention of the City of London, which represents the broader economic and social environment of the story.

Despite being poorly treated, Bob shows a contrasting character of kindness, embodying patience and resilience. Scrooge, known for his initial miserliness and harsh treatment of Bob, undergoes a significant transformation. This change in character is evidenced by his decision to send a large turkey to Bob Cratchit as a surprise Christmas gift, symbolizing his newfound generosity. Furthermore, Scrooge's transformation is highlighted by his promise to raise Bob Cratchit's salary and assist his struggling family, thereby showing a direct positive impact on Bob's life. Additionally, Scrooge grants Bob Christmas Day off, further illustrating his changing attitude towards Bob and his general outlook on life and the welfare of others. This story of transformation and kindness encapsulates the evolving relationship between Scrooge and Bob Cratchit, moving from one of stark power imbalance and mistreatment to one of mutual respect and support.\",65\n4,\"\"\"PROJECT GUTENBERG\"\"\",\"\"\"SCROOGE\"\"\",\"\"\"While there is no direct relationship in the text between Scrooge and Project Gutenberg, the organization facilitates the distribution of stories including Scrooge's, indirectly connecting them.\"\"\",63\n53,\"\"\"SCROOGE\"\"\",\"\"\"CHRISTMAS\"\"\",\"Scrooge's story is deeply intertwined with the celebration of Christmas, which serves as both the backdrop and the catalyst for his profound transformation and redemption. Initially, Scrooge embodies the antithesis of the Christmas spirit, with a contentious relationship towards the holiday characterized by a lack of generosity and warmth. His negative views and attitudes towards Christmas highlight his isolation and miserliness, setting the stage for his journey of self-discovery and change. This journey is facilitated by his experiences with the Ghost, which are central to the narrative and deeply tied to understanding and embracing the true meaning of Christmas. Through these experiences, Scrooge's change of heart and actions become centered around the Christmas holiday, demonstrating a deep connection between his transformation and the event.

However, through his journey of self-reflection and the influence of Tiny Tim's memory and the circumstances of the Cratchit family, Scrooge undergoes a significant change of heart. This transformation is most evident in his actions following his epiphany; Scrooge becomes a second father to Tiny Tim, showcasing a deep, familial bond forged through his newfound generosity. His consideration for Tiny Tim's well-being is further highlighted by his reference to the size of the turkey he provides, ensuring it is ample for Tim and his family. Through these actions, Scrooge's relationship with Tiny Tim evolves into one of care, mentorship, and mutual respect, indicating a complete departure from his former self.\",57\n28,\"\"\"FRED\"\"\",\"\"\"SCROOGE\"\"\",\"Fred is Scrooge's nephew, who not only acknowledges Scrooge's indirect contribution to their merriment but also wishes him well.

He is characterized by his disdain for Christmas and merriment, his resistance to social interaction, and his lack of generosity, particularly towards his clerk and in the spirit of the Christmas season. As Marley's business partner and a man deeply entrenched in his ways of business, Scrooge's life is marked by isolation and a practical, albeit skeptical, approach to life, including a disbelief in the supernatural despite eerie encounters, such as seeing Marley's face on his door knocker.\n\nHowever, Scrooge's character undergoes a profound transformation through a series of supernatural visits that begin on Christmas Eve. Guided by the Ghost of Christmas Past, he is shown scenes from his own life that stir deep emotions and reflections on his actions and attitudes. His interactions with the Spirit of Christmas Present further reveal his curiosity and skepticism, yet he begins to show signs of emotional response and regret for his past behaviors. The visitation by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, showing him visions of his own grave and the aftermath of a man's death, prompts a moment of intense realization and a desperate plea for the chance to change his fate.\n\nThis journey through his past, present, and potential future leads Scrooge to experience a range of emotions, from horror and regret to a newfound sense of joy and generosity. Witnessing scenes of Christmas cheer, participating in games, and observing the Cratchit family indirectly, Scrooge comes to understand the implications of his own life choices. On Christmas Day, he embodies his transformation by buying a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engaging positively with people on the streets, showing a marked change in mood and behavior.\n\nUltimately, Scrooge's transformation is central to the narrative, affecting not only his own life but also those around him, including his clerk's family and his nephew. He becomes a better friend, master, and man, known for keeping Christmas well and for his significant change of heart. Scrooge's story is a testament to the possibility of redemption and the profound impact of reflection, empathy, and the willingness to embrace change.\",52\n9,\"\"\"TINY TIM\"\"\",\"Tiny Tim, the youngest son of Bob Cratchit, is a central figure in \"\"A Christmas Carol,\"\" whose health condition and future are of significant concern to his family and pivotal to the narrative. He is portrayed as a symbol of the Cratchit family's struggles and love, embodying hope amidst adversity. Tiny Tim's physical frailty contrasts with his optimistic and thoughtful nature, making him a memorable and endearing character. His significance extends beyond his family, influencing Ebenezer Scrooge's transformation. Through conversations with a Ghost and Scrooge, Tiny Tim's situation is highlighted, underscoring his importance in the story and to Scrooge's eventual change of heart. Despite his small stature, indicated in a comparison to the size of a turkey, Tiny Tim's spirit and memory have a profound impact on those around him, including Scrooge, who comes to regard him as a second father. Remembered by the Cratchit family as a mild and patient child, Tiny Tim does not succumb to his ailments, benefiting from Scrooge's newfound generosity and compassion. His story is a powerful testament to the themes of hope and redemption that are central to \"\"A Christmas Carol.\"\"\",5\n55,\"\"\"CHRISTMAS DAY\"\"\",\"Christmas Day is a pivotal and significant event within the story, serving as the setting for the story's climax and bringing the Cratchit family together. It is a time that highlights their love, hope, and unity despite hardship, through the traditions of toasts and a shared meal. Moreover, Christmas Day represents hope, joy, and the opportunity for transformation, particularly for Scrooge. It is on this day that Scrooge realizes he hasn't missed the chance to change his ways and acts on his new outlook, embracing the spirit of Christmas. This day is crucial in demonstrating the potential for redemption and the importance of family and kindness in the narrative.\",3\n11,\"\"\"GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST\"\"\",\"The Ghost of Christmas Past is a spectral figure that visits Scrooge to show him scenes from his past. This phantom aims to prompt Scrooge to reflect on his life choices and the impact they have had on himself and others. By presenting these vivid recollections, the spirit seeks to encourage Scrooge to consider the path his life has taken and the potential for change. This encounter is characterized by the ghost's ability to transport Scrooge back in time, allowing him to witness firsthand the moments that have shaped his current disposition and outlook on life.\",3\n23,\"\"\"SCROOGE'S NEPHEW\"\"\",\"Scrooge's nephew, Fred, is the embodiment of the Christmas spirit, contrasting sharply with his uncle Scrooge's skepticism and isolation. Fred is characterized by his cheerful, optimistic nature, and his persistent efforts to share the joy and merriment of the holiday season with Scrooge. He is depicted as a jovial and optimistic character, who not only encourages merriment but also expresses pity for his uncle's bitterness and isolation, especially during Christmas. Fred's involvement in a game of Yes and No, which leads to a revelation that the answer is his uncle Scrooge, further highlights his persistent attempts to connect with and understand his uncle. Through his actions and outlook, Fred serves as a stark contrast to Scrooge, embodying the spirit of Christmas and the potential for change and goodwill towards others.\",2\n25,\"\"\"THE CITY\"\"\",\"The City, as depicted in the narrative, refers to the unspecified urban setting, likely London, where characters such as Scrooge, Bob Cratchit, and Tiny Tim reside. It symbolizes the broader societal context of the story, encapsulating the cold, bleak, and foggy environment that sets a somber tone for the narrative. This setting is crucial as it not only houses Scrooge's counting-house but also vanishes as Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Past travel back in time to his childhood. The City, therefore, serves as a backdrop that reflects the harsh realities of the time and underscores the personal transformation journey of Scrooge.\",2\n76,\"\"\"CHANGE\"\"\",\"\"\"'Change refers to the Royal Exchange in London, a central location for merchants and businessmen where Scrooge and the Phantom observe a conversation.\"\"\",1\n73,\"\"\"CITY\"\"\",\"\"\"The City is where Scrooge and the Phantom find themselves among merchants and business men, indicating its bustling economic activity.\"\"\",1\n26,\"\"\"COUNTING-HOUSE\"\"\",,1\n86,\"\"\"DEATH\"\"\",\"\"\"Death is personified in the text as a pivotal event that catalyzes change and reflection in Scrooge's character.\"\"\",1\n41,\"\"\"EXTINGUISHER\"\"\",,1\n74,\"\"\"JACOB\"\"\",\"\"\"Jacob is mentioned as Scrooge's old partner, whose death is discussed among the businessmen, suggesting his past significance to Scrooge.\"\"\",1\n101,\"\"\"JOE MILLER\"\"\",,1\n32,\"\"\"LONDON\"\"\",\"London is depicted as a significant setting within the narrative, indirectly referenced through the mention of the City of London, which represents the broader economic and social environment of the story.

This change in character is evidenced by his decision to send a large turkey to Bob Cratchit as a surprise Christmas gift, symbolizing his newfound generosity. Furthermore, Scrooge's transformation is highlighted by his promise to raise Bob Cratchit's salary and assist his struggling family, thereby showing a direct positive impact on Bob's life. Additionally, Scrooge grants Bob Christmas Day off, further illustrating his changing attitude towards Bob and his general outlook on life and the welfare of others. This story of transformation and kindness encapsulates the evolving relationship between Scrooge and Bob Cratchit, moving from one of stark power imbalance and mistreatment to one of mutual respect and support.\",65\n4,\"\"\"PROJECT GUTENBERG\"\"\",\"\"\"SCROOGE\"\"\",\"\"\"While there is no direct relationship in the text between Scrooge and Project Gutenberg, the organization facilitates the distribution of stories including Scrooge's, indirectly connecting them.\"\"\",63\n53,\"\"\"SCROOGE\"\"\",\"\"\"CHRISTMAS\"\"\",\"Scrooge's story is deeply intertwined with the celebration of Christmas, which serves as both the backdrop and the catalyst for his profound transformation and redemption. Initially, Scrooge embodies the antithesis of the Christmas spirit, with a contentious relationship towards the holiday characterized by a lack of generosity and warmth. His negative views and attitudes towards Christmas highlight his isolation and miserliness, setting the stage for his journey of self-discovery and change. This journey is facilitated by his experiences with the Ghost, which are central to the narrative and deeply tied to understanding and embracing the true meaning of Christmas. Through these experiences, Scrooge's change of heart and actions become centered around the Christmas holiday, demonstrating a deep connection between his transformation and the event.

Initially, Scrooge's miserly ways and indifferent attitude are seen as contributing to Tiny Tim's bleak future, as foretold by the Ghost. However, through his journey of self-reflection and the influence of Tiny Tim's memory and the circumstances of the Cratchit family, Scrooge undergoes a significant change of heart. This transformation is most evident in his actions following his epiphany; Scrooge becomes a second father to Tiny Tim, showcasing a deep, familial bond forged through his newfound generosity. His consideration for Tiny Tim's well-being is further highlighted by his reference to the size of the turkey he provides, ensuring it is ample for Tim and his family. Through these actions, Scrooge's relationship with Tiny Tim evolves into one of care, mentorship, and mutual respect, indicating a complete departure from his former self.\",57\n28,\"\"\"FRED\"\"\",\"\"\"SCROOGE\"\"\",\"Fred is Scrooge's nephew, who not only acknowledges Scrooge's indirect contribution to their merriment but also wishes him well.

However, the realization that it is still Christmas Day marks a pivotal point in Scrooge's transformation. This moment sparks a series of generous acts, signifying his opportunity to change and act upon his newfound resolutions. The direct link between Scrooge and Christmas Day becomes a symbol of redemption and the positive influence he can have on others' lives, contrasting with the initial negative shadow he cast over the holiday.

The nephew's character is defined by his persistent optimism and efforts to persuade Scrooge to embrace the Christmas spirit, showcasing a stark contrast in their attitudes towards the festive season. Despite Scrooge's initial reluctance, his nephew tirelessly attempts to include him in the festivities, demonstrating a deep familial connection and concern for Scrooge's well-being. This dynamic between them underscores the nephew's determination to invite Scrooge to Christmas every year, highlighting the enduring hope and patience he holds for his uncle's transformation.

He is characterized by his disdain for Christmas and merriment, his resistance to social interaction, and his lack of generosity, particularly towards his clerk and in the spirit of the Christmas season. As Marley's business partner and a man deeply entrenched in his ways of business, Scrooge's life is marked by isolation and a practical, albeit skeptical, approach to life, including a disbelief in the supernatural despite eerie encounters, such as seeing Marley's face on his door knocker.\n\nHowever, Scrooge's character undergoes a profound transformation through a series of supernatural visits that begin on Christmas Eve. Guided by the Ghost of Christmas Past, he is shown scenes from his own life that stir deep emotions and reflections on his actions and attitudes. His interactions with the Spirit of Christmas Present further reveal his curiosity and skepticism, yet he begins to show signs of emotional response and regret for his past behaviors. The visitation by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, showing him visions of his own grave and the aftermath of a man's death, prompts a moment of intense realization and a desperate plea for the chance to change his fate.\n\nThis journey through his past, present, and potential future leads Scrooge to experience a range of emotions, from horror and regret to a newfound sense of joy and generosity. Witnessing scenes of Christmas cheer, participating in games, and observing the Cratchit family indirectly, Scrooge comes to understand the implications of his own life choices. On Christmas Day, he embodies his transformation by buying a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engaging positively with people on the streets, showing a marked change in mood and behavior.\n\nUltimately, Scrooge's transformation is central to the narrative, affecting not only his own life but also those around him, including his clerk's family and his nephew. He becomes a better friend, master, and man, known for keeping Christmas well and for his significant change of heart. Scrooge's story is a testament to the possibility of redemption and the profound impact of reflection, empathy, and the willingness to embrace change.\",52\n9,\"\"\"TINY TIM\"\"\",\"Tiny Tim, the youngest son of Bob Cratchit, is a central figure in \"\"A Christmas Carol,\"\" whose health condition and future are of significant concern to his family and pivotal to the narrative. He is portrayed as a symbol of the Cratchit family's struggles and love, embodying hope amidst adversity. Tiny Tim's physical frailty contrasts with his optimistic and thoughtful nature, making him a memorable and endearing character. His significance extends beyond his family, influencing Ebenezer Scrooge's transformation. Through conversations with a Ghost and Scrooge, Tiny Tim's situation is highlighted, underscoring his importance in the story and to Scrooge's eventual change of heart. Despite his small stature, indicated in a comparison to the size of a turkey, Tiny Tim's spirit and memory have a profound impact on those around him, including Scrooge, who comes to regard him as a second father. Remembered by the Cratchit family as a mild and patient child, Tiny Tim does not succumb to his ailments, benefiting from Scrooge's newfound generosity and compassion. His story is a powerful testament to the themes of hope and redemption that are central to \"\"A Christmas Carol.\"\"\",5\n55,\"\"\"CHRISTMAS DAY\"\"\",\"Christmas Day is a pivotal and significant event within the story, serving as the setting for the story's climax and bringing the Cratchit family together.

His presence and past actions have a significant and lingering effect on Scrooge, indicating a deep connection between the two. This connection is further emphasized by Marley's appearance as a supernatural phenomenon on Scrooge's door knocker, symbolizing his ongoing presence in Scrooge's life. The fact that Marley, now a ghost, was Scrooge's business partner establishes the premise for the ghostly events that follow in the narrative, highlighting the intertwined fates of Marley and Scrooge.\",2\n72,\"\"\"PHANTOM\"\"\",\"The Phantom is a spectral figure that plays a crucial role in guiding Scrooge on his transformative journey. This entity serves as both a silent observer and a catalyst for Scrooge's reflections, showing him a series of scenes that are highly relevant to his life and moral development.

Fred is characterized by his cheerful, optimistic nature, and his persistent efforts to share the joy and merriment of the holiday season with Scrooge. He is depicted as a jovial and optimistic character, who not only encourages merriment but also expresses pity for his uncle's bitterness and isolation, especially during Christmas. Fred's involvement in a game of Yes and No, which leads to a revelation that the answer is his uncle Scrooge, further highlights his persistent attempts to connect with and understand his uncle. Through his actions and outlook, Fred serves as a stark contrast to Scrooge, embodying the spirit of Christmas and the potential for change and goodwill towards others.\",2\n25,\"\"\"THE CITY\"\"\",\"The City, as depicted in the narrative, refers to the unspecified urban setting, likely London, where characters such as Scrooge, Bob Cratchit, and Tiny Tim reside.

He is characterized by his disdain for Christmas and merriment, his resistance to social interaction, and his lack of generosity, particularly towards his clerk and in the spirit of the Christmas season. As Marley's business partner and a man deeply entrenched in his ways of business, Scrooge's life is marked by isolation and a practical, albeit skeptical, approach to life, including a disbelief in the supernatural despite eerie encounters, such as seeing Marley's face on his door knocker.\n\nHowever, Scrooge's character undergoes a profound transformation through a series of supernatural visits that begin on Christmas Eve. Guided by the Ghost of Christmas Past, he is shown scenes from his own life that stir deep emotions and reflections on his actions and attitudes. His interactions with the Spirit of Christmas Present further reveal his curiosity and skepticism, yet he begins to show signs of emotional response and regret for his past behaviors. The visitation by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, showing him visions of his own grave and the aftermath of a man's death, prompts a moment of intense realization and a desperate plea for the chance to change his fate.\n\nThis journey through his past, present, and potential future leads Scrooge to experience a range of emotions, from horror and regret to a newfound sense of joy and generosity. Witnessing scenes of Christmas cheer, participating in games, and observing the Cratchit family indirectly, Scrooge comes to understand the implications of his own life choices. On Christmas Day, he embodies his transformation by buying a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engaging positively with people on the streets, showing a marked change in mood and behavior.\n\nUltimately, Scrooge's transformation is central to the narrative, affecting not only his own life but also those around him, including his clerk's family and his nephew. He becomes a better friend, master, and man, known for keeping Christmas well and for his significant change of heart. Scrooge's story is a testament to the possibility of redemption and the profound impact of reflection, empathy, and the willingness to embrace change.\",52\n9,\"\"\"TINY TIM\"\"\",\"Tiny Tim, the youngest son of Bob Cratchit, is a central figure in \"\"A Christmas Carol,\"\" whose health condition and future are of significant concern to his family and pivotal to the narrative. He is portrayed as a symbol of the Cratchit family's struggles and love, embodying hope amidst adversity. Tiny Tim's physical frailty contrasts with his optimistic and thoughtful nature, making him a memorable and endearing character. His significance extends beyond his family, influencing Ebenezer Scrooge's transformation. Through conversations with a Ghost and Scrooge, Tiny Tim's situation is highlighted, underscoring his importance in the story and to Scrooge's eventual change of heart. Despite his small stature, indicated in a comparison to the size of a turkey, Tiny Tim's spirit and memory have a profound impact on those around him, including Scrooge, who comes to regard him as a second father. Remembered by the Cratchit family as a mild and patient child, Tiny Tim does not succumb to his ailments, benefiting from Scrooge's newfound generosity and compassion. His story is a powerful testament to the themes of hope and redemption that are central to \"\"A Christmas Carol.\"\"\",5\n55,\"\"\"CHRISTMAS DAY\"\"\",\"Christmas Day is a pivotal and significant event within the story, serving as the setting for the story's climax and bringing the Cratchit family together. It is a time that highlights their love, hope, and unity despite hardship, through the traditions of toasts and a shared meal. Moreover, Christmas Day represents hope, joy, and the opportunity for transformation, particularly for Scrooge. It is on this day that Scrooge realizes he hasn't missed the chance to change his ways and acts on his new outlook, embracing the spirit of Christmas. This day is crucial in demonstrating the potential for redemption and the importance of family and kindness in the narrative.\",3\n11,\"\"\"GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST\"\"\",\"The Ghost of Christmas Past is a spectral figure that visits Scrooge to show him scenes from his past. This phantom aims to prompt Scrooge to reflect on his life choices and the impact they have had on himself and others. By presenting these vivid recollections, the spirit seeks to encourage Scrooge to consider the path his life has taken and the potential for change. This encounter is characterized by the ghost's ability to transport Scrooge back in time, allowing him to witness firsthand the moments that have shaped his current disposition and outlook on life.\",3\n77,\"\"\"GREAT FAT MAN\"\"\",,2\n20,\"\"\"MARLEY\"\"\",\"Marley, who is consistently referenced as a deceased individual, was Scrooge's former business partner and has been dead for seven years. His presence and past actions have a significant and lingering effect on Scrooge, indicating a deep connection between the two.

He is characterized by his disdain for Christmas and merriment, his resistance to social interaction, and his lack of generosity, particularly towards his clerk and in the spirit of the Christmas season. As Marley's business partner and a man deeply entrenched in his ways of business, Scrooge's life is marked by isolation and a practical, albeit skeptical, approach to life, including a disbelief in the supernatural despite eerie encounters, such as seeing Marley's face on his door knocker.\n\nHowever, Scrooge's character undergoes a profound transformation through a series of supernatural visits that begin on Christmas Eve. Guided by the Ghost of Christmas Past, he is shown scenes from his own life that stir deep emotions and reflections on his actions and attitudes. His interactions with the Spirit of Christmas Present further reveal his curiosity and skepticism, yet he begins to show signs of emotional response and regret for his past behaviors. The visitation by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, showing him visions of his own grave and the aftermath of a man's death, prompts a moment of intense realization and a desperate plea for the chance to change his fate.\n\nThis journey through his past, present, and potential future leads Scrooge to experience a range of emotions, from horror and regret to a newfound sense of joy and generosity. Witnessing scenes of Christmas cheer, participating in games, and observing the Cratchit family indirectly, Scrooge comes to understand the implications of his own life choices. On Christmas Day, he embodies his transformation by buying a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engaging positively with people on the streets, showing a marked change in mood and behavior.\n\nUltimately, Scrooge's transformation is central to the narrative, affecting not only his own life but also those around him, including his clerk's family and his nephew. He becomes a better friend, master, and man, known for keeping Christmas well and for his significant change of heart. Scrooge's story is a testament to the possibility of redemption and the profound impact of reflection, empathy, and the willingness to embrace change.\",52\n9,\"\"\"TINY TIM\"\"\",\"Tiny Tim, the youngest son of Bob Cratchit, is a central figure in \"\"A Christmas Carol,\"\" whose health condition and future are of significant concern to his family and pivotal to the narrative. He is portrayed as a symbol of the Cratchit family's struggles and love, embodying hope amidst adversity. Tiny Tim's physical frailty contrasts with his optimistic and thoughtful nature, making him a memorable and endearing character. His significance extends beyond his family, influencing Ebenezer Scrooge's transformation. Through conversations with a Ghost and Scrooge, Tiny Tim's situation is highlighted, underscoring his importance in the story and to Scrooge's eventual change of heart. Despite his small stature, indicated in a comparison to the size of a turkey, Tiny Tim's spirit and memory have a profound impact on those around him, including Scrooge, who comes to regard him as a second father. Remembered by the Cratchit family as a mild and patient child, Tiny Tim does not succumb to his ailments, benefiting from Scrooge's newfound generosity and compassion. His story is a powerful testament to the themes of hope and redemption that are central to \"\"A Christmas Carol.\"\"\",5\n55,\"\"\"CHRISTMAS DAY\"\"\",\"Christmas Day is a pivotal and significant event within the story, serving as the setting for the story's climax and bringing the Cratchit family together. It is a time that highlights their love, hope, and unity despite hardship, through the traditions of toasts and a shared meal. Moreover, Christmas Day represents hope, joy, and the opportunity for transformation, particularly for Scrooge. It is on this day that Scrooge realizes he hasn't missed the chance to change his ways and acts on his new outlook, embracing the spirit of Christmas. This day is crucial in demonstrating the potential for redemption and the importance of family and kindness in the narrative.\",3\n11,\"\"\"GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST\"\"\",\"The Ghost of Christmas Past is a spectral figure that visits Scrooge to show him scenes from his past. This phantom aims to prompt Scrooge to reflect on his life choices and the impact they have had on himself and others. By presenting these vivid recollections, the spirit seeks to encourage Scrooge to consider the path his life has taken and the potential for change. This encounter is characterized by the ghost's ability to transport Scrooge back in time, allowing him to witness firsthand the moments that have shaped his current disposition and outlook on life.\",3\n77,\"\"\"GREAT FAT MAN\"\"\",,2\n20,\"\"\"MARLEY\"\"\",\"Marley, who is consistently referenced as a deceased individual, was Scrooge's former business partner and has been dead for seven years. His presence and past actions have a significant and lingering effect on Scrooge, indicating a deep connection between the two. This connection is further emphasized by Marley's appearance as a supernatural phenomenon on Scrooge's door knocker, symbolizing his ongoing presence in Scrooge's life. The fact that Marley, now a ghost, was Scrooge's business partner establishes the premise for the ghostly events that follow in the narrative, highlighting the intertwined fates of Marley and Scrooge.\",2\n72,\"\"\"PHANTOM\"\"\",\"The Phantom is a spectral figure that plays a crucial role in guiding Scrooge on his transformative journey. This entity serves as both a silent observer and a catalyst for Scrooge's reflections, showing him a series of scenes that are highly relevant to his life and moral development. Through these scenes, The Phantom imparts lessons of morality and consequence, effectively serving as a bridge between Scrooge's past, present, and potential future. The Phantom's guidance is instrumental in Scrooge's realization and understanding of the impact of his actions, leading him towards a path of redemption.\",2\n75,\"\"\"RED-FACED GENTLEMAN\"\"\",\"\"\"A red-faced gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on his nose, interested in the deceased's money and the funeral arrangements.\"\"\",2\n21,\"\"\"SCROOGE AND MARLEY\"\"\",\"\"\"Scrooge and Marley is the name of the business firm, indicating its significance in the story and its association with both Scrooge and Marley.\"\"\",2\n23,\"\"\"SCROOGE'S NEPHEW\"\"\",\"Scrooge's nephew, Fred, is the embodiment of the Christmas spirit, contrasting sharply with his uncle Scrooge's skepticism and isolation. Fred is characterized by his cheerful, optimistic nature, and his persistent efforts to share the joy and merriment of the holiday season with Scrooge. He is depicted as a jovial and optimistic character, who not only encourages merriment but also expresses pity for his uncle's bitterness and isolation, especially during Christmas. Fred's involvement in a game of Yes and No, which leads to a revelation that the answer is his uncle Scrooge, further highlights his persistent attempts to connect with and understand his uncle. Through his actions and outlook, Fred serves as a stark contrast to Scrooge, embodying the spirit of Christmas and the potential for change and goodwill towards others.\",2\n25,\"\"\"THE CITY\"\"\",\"The City, as depicted in the narrative, refers to the unspecified urban setting, likely London, where characters such as Scrooge, Bob Cratchit, and Tiny Tim reside. It symbolizes the broader societal context of the story, encapsulating the cold, bleak, and foggy environment that sets a somber tone for the narrative. This setting is crucial as it not only houses Scrooge's counting-house but also vanishes as Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Past travel back in time to his childhood. The City, therefore, serves as a backdrop that reflects the harsh realities of the time and underscores the personal transformation journey of Scrooge.\",2\n84,\"\"\"THE TOWN\"\"\",,2\n76,\"\"\"CHANGE\"\"\",\"\"\"'Change refers to the Royal Exchange in London, a central location for merchants and businessmen where Scrooge and the Phantom observe a conversation.\"\"\",1\n73,\"\"\"CITY\"\"\",\"\"\"The City is where Scrooge and the Phantom find themselves among merchants and business men, indicating its bustling economic activity.\"\"\",1\n26,\"\"\"COUNTING-HOUSE\"\"\",,1\n86,\"\"\"DEATH\"\"\",\"\"\"Death is personified in the text as a pivotal event that catalyzes change and reflection in Scrooge's character.\"\"\",1\n41,\"\"\"EXTINGUISHER\"\"\",,1\n74,\"\"\"JACOB\"\"\",\"\"\"Jacob is mentioned as Scrooge's old partner, whose death is discussed among the businessmen, suggesting his past significance to Scrooge.\"\"\",1\n101,\"\"\"JOE MILLER\"\"\",,1\n32,\"\"\"LONDON\"\"\",\"London is depicted as a significant setting within the narrative, indirectly referenced through the mention of the City of London, which represents the broader economic and social environment of the story.

Scrooge, known for his initial miserliness and harsh treatment of Bob, undergoes a significant transformation. This change in character is evidenced by his decision to send a large turkey to Bob Cratchit as a surprise Christmas gift, symbolizing his newfound generosity. Furthermore, Scrooge's transformation is highlighted by his promise to raise Bob Cratchit's salary and assist his struggling family, thereby showing a direct positive impact on Bob's life. Additionally, Scrooge grants Bob Christmas Day off, further illustrating his changing attitude towards Bob and his general outlook on life and the welfare of others.

Initially, Scrooge embodies the antithesis of the Christmas spirit, with a contentious relationship towards the holiday characterized by a lack of generosity and warmth. His negative views and attitudes towards Christmas highlight his isolation and miserliness, setting the stage for his journey of self-discovery and change. This journey is facilitated by his experiences with the Ghost, which are central to the narrative and deeply tied to understanding and embracing the true meaning of Christmas.

Initially, Scrooge's miserly ways and indifferent attitude are seen as contributing to Tiny Tim's bleak future, as foretold by the Ghost. However, through his journey of self-reflection and the influence of Tiny Tim's memory and the circumstances of the Cratchit family, Scrooge undergoes a significant change of heart. This transformation is most evident in his actions following his epiphany; Scrooge becomes a second father to Tiny Tim, showcasing a deep, familial bond forged through his newfound generosity. His consideration for Tiny Tim's well-being is further highlighted by his reference to the size of the turkey he provides, ensuring it is ample for Tim and his family. Through these actions, Scrooge's relationship with Tiny Tim evolves into one of care, mentorship, and mutual respect, indicating a complete departure from his former self.\",57\n28,\"\"\"FRED\"\"\",\"\"\"SCROOGE\"\"\",\"Fred is Scrooge's nephew, who not only acknowledges Scrooge's indirect contribution to their merriment but also wishes him well.

This partnership was not only professional but also personal, as evidenced by Scrooge being deeply affected by Marley's passing. The depth of their connection is further highlighted by Scrooge being haunted by the supernatural appearance of Marley's face, a clear sign of unresolved issues and a strong, ongoing bond between them. Scrooge's cautious behavior upon entering his house, reacting nervously to the door's knocker and anticipating the sight of Marley's pigtail, underscores the profound and uneasy connection he feels towards Marley.

He is characterized by his disdain for Christmas and merriment, his resistance to social interaction, and his lack of generosity, particularly towards his clerk and in the spirit of the Christmas season. As Marley's business partner and a man deeply entrenched in his ways of business, Scrooge's life is marked by isolation and a practical, albeit skeptical, approach to life, including a disbelief in the supernatural despite eerie encounters, such as seeing Marley's face on his door knocker.\n\nHowever, Scrooge's character undergoes a profound transformation through a series of supernatural visits that begin on Christmas Eve. Guided by the Ghost of Christmas Past, he is shown scenes from his own life that stir deep emotions and reflections on his actions and attitudes. His interactions with the Spirit of Christmas Present further reveal his curiosity and skepticism, yet he begins to show signs of emotional response and regret for his past behaviors. The visitation by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, showing him visions of his own grave and the aftermath of a man's death, prompts a moment of intense realization and a desperate plea for the chance to change his fate.\n\nThis journey through his past, present, and potential future leads Scrooge to experience a range of emotions, from horror and regret to a newfound sense of joy and generosity. Witnessing scenes of Christmas cheer, participating in games, and observing the Cratchit family indirectly, Scrooge comes to understand the implications of his own life choices. On Christmas Day, he embodies his transformation by buying a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engaging positively with people on the streets, showing a marked change in mood and behavior.\n\nUltimately, Scrooge's transformation is central to the narrative, affecting not only his own life but also those around him, including his clerk's family and his nephew. He becomes a better friend, master, and man, known for keeping Christmas well and for his significant change of heart. Scrooge's story is a testament to the possibility of redemption and the profound impact of reflection, empathy, and the willingness to embrace change.\",52\n9,\"\"\"TINY TIM\"\"\",\"Tiny Tim, the youngest son of Bob Cratchit, is a central figure in \"\"A Christmas Carol,\"\" whose health condition and future are of significant concern to his family and pivotal to the narrative. He is portrayed as a symbol of the Cratchit family's struggles and love, embodying hope amidst adversity. Tiny Tim's physical frailty contrasts with his optimistic and thoughtful nature, making him a memorable and endearing character. His significance extends beyond his family, influencing Ebenezer Scrooge's transformation. Through conversations with a Ghost and Scrooge, Tiny Tim's situation is highlighted, underscoring his importance in the story and to Scrooge's eventual change of heart. Despite his small stature, indicated in a comparison to the size of a turkey, Tiny Tim's spirit and memory have a profound impact on those around him, including Scrooge, who comes to regard him as a second father. Remembered by the Cratchit family as a mild and patient child, Tiny Tim does not succumb to his ailments, benefiting from Scrooge's newfound generosity and compassion. His story is a powerful testament to the themes of hope and redemption that are central to \"\"A Christmas Carol.\"\"\",5\n55,\"\"\"CHRISTMAS DAY\"\"\",\"Christmas Day is a pivotal and significant event within the story, serving as the setting for the story's climax and bringing the Cratchit family together. It is a time that highlights their love, hope, and unity despite hardship, through the traditions of toasts and a shared meal. Moreover, Christmas Day represents hope, joy, and the opportunity for transformation, particularly for Scrooge. It is on this day that Scrooge realizes he hasn't missed the chance to change his ways and acts on his new outlook, embracing the spirit of Christmas. This day is crucial in demonstrating the potential for redemption and the importance of family and kindness in the narrative.\",3\n11,\"\"\"GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST\"\"\",\"The Ghost of Christmas Past is a spectral figure that visits Scrooge to show him scenes from his past. This phantom aims to prompt Scrooge to reflect on his life choices and the impact they have had on himself and others. By presenting these vivid recollections, the spirit seeks to encourage Scrooge to consider the path his life has taken and the potential for change. This encounter is characterized by the ghost's ability to transport Scrooge back in time, allowing him to witness firsthand the moments that have shaped his current disposition and outlook on life.\",3\n77,\"\"\"GREAT FAT MAN\"\"\",,2\n20,\"\"\"MARLEY\"\"\",\"Marley, who is consistently referenced as a deceased individual, was Scrooge's former business partner and has been dead for seven years. His presence and past actions have a significant and lingering effect on Scrooge, indicating a deep connection between the two. This connection is further emphasized by Marley's appearance as a supernatural phenomenon on Scrooge's door knocker, symbolizing his ongoing presence in Scrooge's life. The fact that Marley, now a ghost, was Scrooge's business partner establishes the premise for the ghostly events that follow in the narrative, highlighting the intertwined fates of Marley and Scrooge.\",2\n72,\"\"\"PHANTOM\"\"\",\"The Phantom is a spectral figure that plays a crucial role in guiding Scrooge on his transformative journey. This entity serves as both a silent observer and a catalyst for Scrooge's reflections, showing him a series of scenes that are highly relevant to his life and moral development. Through these scenes, The Phantom imparts lessons of morality and consequence, effectively serving as a bridge between Scrooge's past, present, and potential future. The Phantom's guidance is instrumental in Scrooge's realization and understanding of the impact of his actions, leading him towards a path of redemption.\",2\n75,\"\"\"RED-FACED GENTLEMAN\"\"\",\"\"\"A red-faced gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on his nose, interested in the deceased's money and the funeral arrangements.\"\"\",2\n21,\"\"\"SCROOGE AND MARLEY\"\"\",\"\"\"Scrooge and Marley is the name of the business firm, indicating its significance in the story and its association with both Scrooge and Marley.\"\"\",2\n23,\"\"\"SCROOGE'S NEPHEW\"\"\",\"Scrooge's nephew, Fred, is the embodiment of the Christmas spirit, contrasting sharply with his uncle Scrooge's skepticism and isolation. Fred is characterized by his cheerful, optimistic nature, and his persistent efforts to share the joy and merriment of the holiday season with Scrooge. He is depicted as a jovial and optimistic character, who not only encourages merriment but also expresses pity for his uncle's bitterness and isolation, especially during Christmas. Fred's involvement in a game of Yes and No, which leads to a revelation that the answer is his uncle Scrooge, further highlights his persistent attempts to connect with and understand his uncle. Through his actions and outlook, Fred serves as a stark contrast to Scrooge, embodying the spirit of Christmas and the potential for change and goodwill towards others.\",2\n25,\"\"\"THE CITY\"\"\",\"The City, as depicted in the narrative, refers to the unspecified urban setting, likely London, where characters such as Scrooge, Bob Cratchit, and Tiny Tim reside. It symbolizes the broader societal context of the story, encapsulating the cold, bleak, and foggy environment that sets a somber tone for the narrative. This setting is crucial as it not only houses Scrooge's counting-house but also vanishes as Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Past travel back in time to his childhood. The City, therefore, serves as a backdrop that reflects the harsh realities of the time and underscores the personal transformation journey of Scrooge.\",2\n84,\"\"\"THE TOWN\"\"\",,2\n76,\"\"\"CHANGE\"\"\",\"\"\"'Change refers to the Royal Exchange in London, a central location for merchants and businessmen where Scrooge and the Phantom observe a conversation.\"\"\",1\n73,\"\"\"CITY\"\"\",\"\"\"The City is where Scrooge and the Phantom find themselves among merchants and business men, indicating its bustling economic activity.\"\"\",1\n26,\"\"\"COUNTING-HOUSE\"\"\",,1\n86,\"\"\"DEATH\"\"\",\"\"\"Death is personified in the text as a pivotal event that catalyzes change and reflection in Scrooge's character.\"\"\",1\n41,\"\"\"EXTINGUISHER\"\"\",,1\n74,\"\"\"JACOB\"\"\",\"\"\"Jacob is mentioned as Scrooge's old partner, whose death is discussed among the businessmen, suggesting his past significance to Scrooge.\"\"\",1\n101,\"\"\"JOE MILLER\"\"\",,1\n32,\"\"\"LONDON\"\"\",\"London is depicted as a significant setting within the narrative, indirectly referenced through the mention of the City of London, which represents the broader economic and social environment of the story.

He is characterized by his disdain for Christmas and merriment, his resistance to social interaction, and his lack of generosity, particularly towards his clerk and in the spirit of the Christmas season. As Marley's business partner and a man deeply entrenched in his ways of business, Scrooge's life is marked by isolation and a practical, albeit skeptical, approach to life, including a disbelief in the supernatural despite eerie encounters, such as seeing Marley's face on his door knocker.\n\nHowever, Scrooge's character undergoes a profound transformation through a series of supernatural visits that begin on Christmas Eve. Guided by the Ghost of Christmas Past, he is shown scenes from his own life that stir deep emotions and reflections on his actions and attitudes. His interactions with the Spirit of Christmas Present further reveal his curiosity and skepticism, yet he begins to show signs of emotional response and regret for his past behaviors. The visitation by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, showing him visions of his own grave and the aftermath of a man's death, prompts a moment of intense realization and a desperate plea for the chance to change his fate.\n\nThis journey through his past, present, and potential future leads Scrooge to experience a range of emotions, from horror and regret to a newfound sense of joy and generosity. Witnessing scenes of Christmas cheer, participating in games, and observing the Cratchit family indirectly, Scrooge comes to understand the implications of his own life choices. On Christmas Day, he embodies his transformation by buying a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engaging positively with people on the streets, showing a marked change in mood and behavior.\n\nUltimately, Scrooge's transformation is central to the narrative, affecting not only his own life but also those around him, including his clerk's family and his nephew. He becomes a better friend, master, and man, known for keeping Christmas well and for his significant change of heart. Scrooge's story is a testament to the possibility of redemption and the profound impact of reflection, empathy, and the willingness to embrace change.\",52\n9,\"\"\"TINY TIM\"\"\",\"Tiny Tim, the youngest son of Bob Cratchit, is a central figure in \"\"A Christmas Carol,\"\" whose health condition and future are of significant concern to his family and pivotal to the narrative. He is portrayed as a symbol of the Cratchit family's struggles and love, embodying hope amidst adversity. Tiny Tim's physical frailty contrasts with his optimistic and thoughtful nature, making him a memorable and endearing character. His significance extends beyond his family, influencing Ebenezer Scrooge's transformation. Through conversations with a Ghost and Scrooge, Tiny Tim's situation is highlighted, underscoring his importance in the story and to Scrooge's eventual change of heart. Despite his small stature, indicated in a comparison to the size of a turkey, Tiny Tim's spirit and memory have a profound impact on those around him, including Scrooge, who comes to regard him as a second father. Remembered by the Cratchit family as a mild and patient child, Tiny Tim does not succumb to his ailments, benefiting from Scrooge's newfound generosity and compassion. His story is a powerful testament to the themes of hope and redemption that are central to \"\"A Christmas Carol.\"\"\",5\n55,\"\"\"CHRISTMAS DAY\"\"\",\"Christmas Day is a pivotal and significant event within the story, serving as the setting for the story's climax and bringing the Cratchit family together. It is a time that highlights their love, hope, and unity despite hardship, through the traditions of toasts and a shared meal. Moreover, Christmas Day represents hope, joy, and the opportunity for transformation, particularly for Scrooge. It is on this day that Scrooge realizes he hasn't missed the chance to change his ways and acts on his new outlook, embracing the spirit of Christmas. This day is crucial in demonstrating the potential for redemption and the importance of family and kindness in the narrative.\",3\n11,\"\"\"GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST\"\"\",\"The Ghost of Christmas Past is a spectral figure that visits Scrooge to show him scenes from his past. This phantom aims to prompt Scrooge to reflect on his life choices and the impact they have had on himself and others. By presenting these vivid recollections, the spirit seeks to encourage Scrooge to consider the path his life has taken and the potential for change. This encounter is characterized by the ghost's ability to transport Scrooge back in time, allowing him to witness firsthand the moments that have shaped his current disposition and outlook on life.\",3\n77,\"\"\"GREAT FAT MAN\"\"\",,2\n20,\"\"\"MARLEY\"\"\",\"Marley, who is consistently referenced as a deceased individual, was Scrooge's former business partner and has been dead for seven years. His presence and past actions have a significant and lingering effect on Scrooge, indicating a deep connection between the two. This connection is further emphasized by Marley's appearance as a supernatural phenomenon on Scrooge's door knocker, symbolizing his ongoing presence in Scrooge's life. The fact that Marley, now a ghost, was Scrooge's business partner establishes the premise for the ghostly events that follow in the narrative, highlighting the intertwined fates of Marley and Scrooge.\",2\n72,\"\"\"PHANTOM\"\"\",\"The Phantom is a spectral figure that plays a crucial role in guiding Scrooge on his transformative journey. This entity serves as both a silent observer and a catalyst for Scrooge's reflections, showing him a series of scenes that are highly relevant to his life and moral development. Through these scenes, The Phantom imparts lessons of morality and consequence, effectively serving as a bridge between Scrooge's past, present, and potential future. The Phantom's guidance is instrumental in Scrooge's realization and understanding of the impact of his actions, leading him towards a path of redemption.\",2\n75,\"\"\"RED-FACED GENTLEMAN\"\"\",\"\"\"A red-faced gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on his nose, interested in the deceased's money and the funeral arrangements.\"\"\",2\n21,\"\"\"SCROOGE AND MARLEY\"\"\",\"\"\"Scrooge and Marley is the name of the business firm, indicating its significance in the story and its association with both Scrooge and Marley.\"\"\",2\n23,\"\"\"SCROOGE'S NEPHEW\"\"\",\"Scrooge's nephew, Fred, is the embodiment of the Christmas spirit, contrasting sharply with his uncle Scrooge's skepticism and isolation. Fred is characterized by his cheerful, optimistic nature, and his persistent efforts to share the joy and merriment of the holiday season with Scrooge. He is depicted as a jovial and optimistic character, who not only encourages merriment but also expresses pity for his uncle's bitterness and isolation, especially during Christmas. Fred's involvement in a game of Yes and No, which leads to a revelation that the answer is his uncle Scrooge, further highlights his persistent attempts to connect with and understand his uncle. Through his actions and outlook, Fred serves as a stark contrast to Scrooge, embodying the spirit of Christmas and the potential for change and goodwill towards others.\",2\n25,\"\"\"THE CITY\"\"\",\"The City, as depicted in the narrative, refers to the unspecified urban setting, likely London, where characters such as Scrooge, Bob Cratchit, and Tiny Tim reside. It symbolizes the broader societal context of the story, encapsulating the cold, bleak, and foggy environment that sets a somber tone for the narrative. This setting is crucial as it not only houses Scrooge's counting-house but also vanishes as Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Past travel back in time to his childhood.
