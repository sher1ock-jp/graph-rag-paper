Then the shouting and the struggling, and the\nonslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him, with\nchairs for ladders, to dive into his pockets, despoil him of\nbrown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his\nneck, pummel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The\nshouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package\nwas received!

'That they are what they are do not blame me!'\n\n'Remove me!' Scrooge exclaimed, 'I cannot bear it!'\n\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a\nface, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces\nit had shown him, wrestled with it.\n\n'Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!'\n\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost\nwith no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort\nof its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and\nbright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized\nthe extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its\nhead.\n\n[Illustration: _Laden with Christmas toys and presents_]\n\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its\nwhole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he\ncould not hide the light, which streamed from under it, in an unbroken\nflood upon the ground.\n\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible\ndrowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom.

He felt that he was\nrestored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial\npurpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to\nhim through Jacob Marley's intervention. But finding that he turned\nuncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this\nnew spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own\nhands, and, lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the\nbed.

Is it a foot or a\nclaw?'\n\n'It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,' was the Spirit's\nsorrowful reply. 'Look here!'\n\nFrom the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject,\nfrightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung\nupon the outside of its garment.\n\n'O Man! look here! Look, look down here!' exclaimed the Ghost.\n\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but\nprostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\nfilled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a\nstale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted\nthem, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat\nenthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no\ndegradation, no perversion of humanity in any grade, through all the\nmysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and\ndread.\n\nScrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he\ntried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves,\nrather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\n\n'Spirit! are they yours?' Scrooge could say no more.\n\n'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they\ncling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This\ngirl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of\nall beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,\nunless the writing be erased. Deny it!' cried the Spirit, stretching out\nhis hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for\nyour factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!'\n\n'Have they no refuge or resource?' cried Scrooge.\n\n'Are there no prisons?' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last\ntime with his own words. 'Are there no workhouses?'\n\nThe bell struck Twelve.\n\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last\nstroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob\nMarley, and, lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and\nhooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.\n\n\nSTAVE FOUR\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST OF THE SPIRITS\n\n\nThe Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near him,\nScrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this\nSpirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\n\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched\nhand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\nsurrounded.\n\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n\n'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said\nScrooge.\n\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n\n'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\nbut will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,\nSpirit?'\n\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\nhe received.\n\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\nrecover.\n\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,\nuncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\nheap of black.\n\n'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre\nI have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope\nto live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your\ncompany, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?'\n\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n\n'Lead on!' said Scrooge. 'Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is\nprecious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!'\n\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in\nthe shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him\nalong.\n\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to\nspring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there they\nwere in the heart of it; on 'Change, amongst the merchants,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Is it a foot or a\nclaw?'\n\n'It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,' was the Spirit's\nsorrowful reply. 'Look here!'\n\nFrom the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject,\nfrightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung\nupon the outside of its garment.\n\n'O Man! look here! Look, look down here!' exclaimed the Ghost.\n\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but\nprostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\nfilled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a\nstale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted\nthem, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat\nenthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no\ndegradation, no perversion of humanity in any grade, through all the\nmysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and\ndread.\n\nScrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he\ntried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves,\nrather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\n\n'Spirit! are they yours?' Scrooge could say no more.\n\n'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they\ncling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This\ngirl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of\nall beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,\nunless the writing be erased. Deny it!' cried the Spirit, stretching out\nhis hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for\nyour factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!'\n\n'Have they no refuge or resource?' cried Scrooge.\n\n'Are there no prisons?' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last\ntime with his own words. 'Are there no workhouses?'\n\nThe bell struck Twelve.\n\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last\nstroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob\nMarley, and, lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and\nhooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.\n\n\nSTAVE FOUR\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST OF THE SPIRITS\n\n\nThe Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near him,\nScrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this\nSpirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\n\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched\nhand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\nsurrounded.\n\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n\n'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said\nScrooge.\n\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n\n'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\nbut will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,\nSpirit?'\n\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\nhe received.\n\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\nrecover.\n\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,\nuncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\nheap of black.\n\n'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre\nI have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope\nto live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your\ncompany, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?'\n\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n\n'Lead on!' said Scrooge. 'Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is\nprecious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!'\n\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in\nthe shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him\nalong.\n\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to\nspring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there they\nwere in the heart of it; on 'Change, amongst the merchants,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Scrooge exclaimed, 'I cannot bear it!'\n\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a\nface, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces\nit had shown him, wrestled with it.\n\n'Leave me! Take me back.

Is it a foot or a\nclaw?'\n\n'It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,' was the Spirit's\nsorrowful reply. 'Look here!'\n\nFrom the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject,\nfrightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung\nupon the outside of its garment.\n\n'O Man! look here! Look, look down here!' exclaimed the Ghost.\n\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but\nprostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\nfilled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a\nstale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted\nthem, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat\nenthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no\ndegradation, no perversion of humanity in any grade, through all the\nmysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and\ndread.\n\nScrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he\ntried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves,\nrather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\n\n'Spirit! are they yours?' Scrooge could say no more.\n\n'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they\ncling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This\ngirl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of\nall beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,\nunless the writing be erased. Deny it!' cried the Spirit, stretching out\nhis hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for\nyour factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!'\n\n'Have they no refuge or resource?' cried Scrooge.\n\n'Are there no prisons?' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last\ntime with his own words. 'Are there no workhouses?'\n\nThe bell struck Twelve.\n\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last\nstroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob\nMarley, and, lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and\nhooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.\n\n\nSTAVE FOUR\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST OF THE SPIRITS\n\n\nThe Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near him,\nScrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this\nSpirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\n\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched\nhand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\nsurrounded.\n\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n\n'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said\nScrooge.\n\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n\n'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\nbut will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,\nSpirit?'\n\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\nhe received.\n\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\nrecover.\n\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,\nuncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\nheap of black.\n\n'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre\nI have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope\nto live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your\ncompany, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?'\n\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n\n'Lead on!' said Scrooge. 'Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is\nprecious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!'\n\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in\nthe shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him\nalong.\n\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to\nspring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there they\nwere in the heart of it; on 'Change, amongst the merchants,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The scaling him, with\nchairs for ladders, to dive into his pockets, despoil him of\nbrown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his\nneck, pummel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The\nshouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package\nwas received! The terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in\nthe act of putting a doll's frying pan into his mouth, and was more than\nsuspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden\nplatter! The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy, and\ngratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike. It is enough\nthat, by degrees, the children and their emotions got out of the\nparlour, and, by one stair at a time, up to the top of the house, where\nthey went to bed, and so subsided.\n\nAnd now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of\nthe house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her\nand her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such\nanother creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have\ncalled him father, and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his\nlife, his sight grew very dim indeed.\n\n'Belle,' said the husband, turning to his wife with a smile, 'I saw an\nold friend of yours this afternoon.'\n\n'Who was it?'\n\n'Guess!'\n\n'How can I? Tut, don't I know?' she added in the same breath, laughing\nas he laughed. 'Mr. Scrooge.'\n\n'Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as it was not shut\nup, and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing him. His\npartner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat alone.\nQuite alone in the world, I do believe.'\n\n'Spirit!' said Scrooge in a broken voice, 'remove me from this place.'\n\n'I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,' said the\nGhost. 'That they are what they are do not blame me!'\n\n'Remove me!' Scrooge exclaimed, 'I cannot bear it!'\n\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a\nface, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces\nit had shown him, wrestled with it.\n\n'Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!'\n\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost\nwith no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort\nof its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and\nbright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized\nthe extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its\nhead.\n\n[Illustration: _Laden with Christmas toys and presents_]\n\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its\nwhole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he\ncould not hide the light, which streamed from under it, in an unbroken\nflood upon the ground.\n\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible\ndrowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a\nparting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel\nto bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nSTAVE THREE\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS\n\n\nAwaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in\nbed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told\nthat the bell was again upon the stroke of One. He felt that he was\nrestored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial\npurpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to\nhim through Jacob Marley's intervention. But finding that he turned\nuncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this\nnew spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own\nhands, and, lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the\nbed. For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\nappearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.\n\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being\n######################\nOutput:"}}

'Look here!'\n\nFrom the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject,\nfrightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung\nupon the outside of its garment.\n\n'O Man! look here! Look, look down here!' exclaimed the Ghost.\n\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but\nprostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\nfilled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a\nstale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted\nthem, and pulled them into shreds.

Scrooge could say no more.\n\n'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they\ncling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This\ngirl is Want.

'Are there no workhouses?'\n\nThe bell struck Twelve.\n\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not.

When it came near him,\nScrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this\nSpirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\n\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched\nhand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\nsurrounded.\n\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n\n'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said\nScrooge.\n\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n\n'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\nbut will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,\nSpirit?'\n\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\nhe received.\n\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\nrecover.\n\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,\nuncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\nheap of black.\n\n'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre\nI have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope\nto live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your\ncompany, and do it with a thankful heart.

'That they are what they are do not blame me!'\n\n'Remove me!' Scrooge exclaimed, 'I cannot bear it!'\n\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a\nface, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces\nit had shown him, wrestled with it.\n\n'Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!'\n\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost\nwith no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort\nof its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and\nbright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized\nthe extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its\nhead.\n\n[Illustration: _Laden with Christmas toys and presents_]\n\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its\nwhole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he\ncould not hide the light, which streamed from under it, in an unbroken\nflood upon the ground.\n\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible\ndrowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a\nparting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel\nto bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nSTAVE THREE\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS\n\n\nAwaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in\nbed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told\nthat the bell was again upon the stroke of One. He felt that he was\nrestored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial\npurpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to\nhim through Jacob Marley's intervention.

Is it a foot or a\nclaw?'\n\n'It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,' was the Spirit's\nsorrowful reply. 'Look here!'\n\nFrom the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject,\nfrightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung\nupon the outside of its garment.\n\n'O Man! look here! Look, look down here!' exclaimed the Ghost.\n\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but\nprostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\nfilled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a\nstale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted\nthem, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat\nenthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no\ndegradation, no perversion of humanity in any grade, through all the\nmysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and\ndread.\n\nScrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he\ntried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves,\nrather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\n\n'Spirit! are they yours?' Scrooge could say no more.\n\n'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they\ncling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This\ngirl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of\nall beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,\nunless the writing be erased. Deny it!' cried the Spirit, stretching out\nhis hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for\nyour factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!'\n\n'Have they no refuge or resource?' cried Scrooge.\n\n'Are there no prisons?' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last\ntime with his own words. 'Are there no workhouses?'\n\nThe bell struck Twelve.\n\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last\nstroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob\nMarley, and, lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and\nhooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.\n\n\nSTAVE FOUR\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST OF THE SPIRITS\n\n\nThe Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near him,\nScrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this\nSpirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\n\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched\nhand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\nsurrounded.\n\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n\n'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said\nScrooge.\n\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n\n'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\nbut will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,\nSpirit?'\n\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\nhe received.\n\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\nrecover.\n\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,\nuncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\nheap of black.\n\n'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre\nI have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope\nto live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your\ncompany, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?'\n\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n\n'Lead on!' said Scrooge. 'Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is\nprecious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!'\n\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in\nthe shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him\nalong.\n\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to\nspring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there they\nwere in the heart of it; on 'Change, amongst the merchants,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Then the shouting and the struggling, and the\nonslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him, with\nchairs for ladders, to dive into his pockets, despoil him of\nbrown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his\nneck, pummel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The\nshouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package\nwas received!

'That they are what they are do not blame me!'\n\n'Remove me!' Scrooge exclaimed, 'I cannot bear it!'\n\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a\nface, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces\nit had shown him, wrestled with it.\n\n'Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!'\n\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost\nwith no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort\nof its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and\nbright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized\nthe extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its\nhead.\n\n[Illustration: _Laden with Christmas toys and presents_]\n\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its\nwhole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he\ncould not hide the light, which streamed from under it, in an unbroken\nflood upon the ground.\n\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible\ndrowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom.

He felt that he was\nrestored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial\npurpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to\nhim through Jacob Marley's intervention. But finding that he turned\nuncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this\nnew spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own\nhands, and, lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the\nbed.

Is it a foot or a\nclaw?'\n\n'It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,' was the Spirit's\nsorrowful reply. 'Look here!'\n\nFrom the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject,\nfrightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung\nupon the outside of its garment.\n\n'O Man! look here! Look, look down here!' exclaimed the Ghost.\n\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but\nprostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\nfilled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a\nstale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted\nthem, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat\nenthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no\ndegradation, no perversion of humanity in any grade, through all the\nmysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and\ndread.\n\nScrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he\ntried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves,\nrather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\n\n'Spirit! are they yours?' Scrooge could say no more.\n\n'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they\ncling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This\ngirl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of\nall beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,\nunless the writing be erased. Deny it!' cried the Spirit, stretching out\nhis hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for\nyour factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!'\n\n'Have they no refuge or resource?' cried Scrooge.\n\n'Are there no prisons?' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last\ntime with his own words. 'Are there no workhouses?'\n\nThe bell struck Twelve.\n\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last\nstroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob\nMarley, and, lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and\nhooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.\n\n\nSTAVE FOUR\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST OF THE SPIRITS\n\n\nThe Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near him,\nScrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this\nSpirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\n\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched\nhand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\nsurrounded.\n\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n\n'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said\nScrooge.\n\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n\n'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\nbut will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,\nSpirit?'\n\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\nhe received.\n\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\nrecover.\n\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,\nuncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\nheap of black.\n\n'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre\nI have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope\nto live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your\ncompany, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?'\n\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n\n'Lead on!' said Scrooge. 'Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is\nprecious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!'\n\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him.

The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy, and\ngratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike. It is enough\nthat, by degrees, the children and their emotions got out of the\nparlour, and, by one stair at a time, up to the top of the house, where\nthey went to bed, and so subsided.\n\nAnd now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of\nthe house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her\nand her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such\nanother creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have\ncalled him father, and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his\nlife, his sight grew very dim indeed.\n\n'Belle,' said the husband, turning to his wife with a smile, 'I saw an\nold friend of yours this afternoon.'\n\n'Who was it?'\n\n'Guess!'\n\n'How can I? Tut, don't I know?' she added in the same breath, laughing\nas he laughed. 'Mr. Scrooge.'\n\n'Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as it was not shut\nup, and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing him. His\npartner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat alone.\nQuite alone in the world, I do believe.'\n\n'Spirit!' said Scrooge in a broken voice, 'remove me from this place.'\n\n'I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,' said the\nGhost. 'That they are what they are do not blame me!'\n\n'Remove me!' Scrooge exclaimed, 'I cannot bear it!'\n\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a\nface, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces\nit had shown him, wrestled with it.\n\n'Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!'\n\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost\nwith no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort\nof its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and\nbright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized\nthe extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its\nhead.\n\n[Illustration: _Laden with Christmas toys and presents_]\n\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its\nwhole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he\ncould not hide the light, which streamed from under it, in an unbroken\nflood upon the ground.\n\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible\ndrowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a\nparting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel\nto bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nSTAVE THREE\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS\n\n\nAwaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in\nbed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told\nthat the bell was again upon the stroke of One. He felt that he was\nrestored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial\npurpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to\nhim through Jacob Marley's intervention. But finding that he turned\nuncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this\nnew spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own\nhands, and, lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the\nbed. For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\nappearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.\n\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being\n######################\nOutput:"}}

'Look here!'\n\nFrom the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject,\nfrightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung\nupon the outside of its garment.\n\n'O Man! look here! Look, look down here!' exclaimed the Ghost.\n\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but\nprostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\nfilled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a\nstale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted\nthem, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat\nenthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing.

Having them shown to him in this way, he\ntried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves,\nrather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\n\n'Spirit! are they yours?' Scrooge could say no more.\n\n'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they\ncling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This\ngirl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of\nall beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,\nunless the writing be erased. Deny it!' cried the Spirit, stretching out\nhis hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for\nyour factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!'\n\n'Have they no refuge or resource?' cried Scrooge.\n\n'Are there no prisons?' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last\ntime with his own words. 'Are there no workhouses?'\n\nThe bell struck Twelve.\n\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last\nstroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob\nMarley, and, lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and\nhooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.\n\n\nSTAVE FOUR\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST OF THE SPIRITS\n\n\nThe Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near him,\nScrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this\nSpirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\n\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched\nhand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\nsurrounded.\n\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n\n'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said\nScrooge.\n\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n\n'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\nbut will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,\nSpirit?'\n\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\nhe received.\n\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\nrecover.\n\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,\nuncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\nheap of black.\n\n'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre\nI have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope\nto live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your\ncompany, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?'\n\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n\n'Lead on!' said Scrooge. 'Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is\nprecious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!'\n\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in\nthe shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him\nalong.\n\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to\nspring up about them, and encompass them of its own act.

Then the shouting and the struggling, and the\nonslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him, with\nchairs for ladders, to dive into his pockets, despoil him of\nbrown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his\nneck, pummel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The\nshouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package\nwas received! The terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in\nthe act of putting a doll's frying pan into his mouth, and was more than\nsuspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden\nplatter! The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy, and\ngratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike.

Tut, don't I know?' she added in the same breath, laughing\nas he laughed. 'Mr. Scrooge.'\n\n'Mr. Scrooge it was.

His\npartner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat alone.\nQuite alone in the world, I do believe.'\n\n'Spirit!' said Scrooge in a broken voice, 'remove me from this place.'\n\n'I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,' said the\nGhost. 'That they are what they are do not blame me!'\n\n'Remove me!' Scrooge exclaimed, 'I cannot bear it!'\n\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a\nface, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces\nit had shown him, wrestled with it.\n\n'Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!'\n\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost\nwith no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort\nof its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and\nbright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized\nthe extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its\nhead.\n\n[Illustration: _Laden with Christmas toys and presents_]\n\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its\nwhole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he\ncould not hide the light, which streamed from under it, in an unbroken\nflood upon the ground.\n\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible\ndrowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a\nparting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel\nto bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nSTAVE THREE\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS\n\n\nAwaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in\nbed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told\nthat the bell was again upon the stroke of One. He felt that he was\nrestored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial\npurpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to\nhim through Jacob Marley's intervention. But finding that he turned\nuncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this\nnew spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own\nhands, and, lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the\nbed.

Is it a foot or a\nclaw?'\n\n'It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,' was the Spirit's\nsorrowful reply. 'Look here!'\n\nFrom the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject,\nfrightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung\nupon the outside of its garment.\n\n'O Man! look here! Look, look down here!' exclaimed the Ghost.\n\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but\nprostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\nfilled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a\nstale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted\nthem, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat\nenthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no\ndegradation, no perversion of humanity in any grade, through all the\nmysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and\ndread.\n\nScrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he\ntried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves,\nrather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\n\n'Spirit! are they yours?' Scrooge could say no more.\n\n'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they\ncling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This\ngirl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of\nall beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,\nunless the writing be erased. Deny it!' cried the Spirit, stretching out\nhis hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for\nyour factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!'\n\n'Have they no refuge or resource?' cried Scrooge.\n\n'Are there no prisons?' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last\ntime with his own words. 'Are there no workhouses?'\n\nThe bell struck Twelve.\n\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last\nstroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob\nMarley, and, lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and\nhooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.\n\n\nSTAVE FOUR\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST OF THE SPIRITS\n\n\nThe Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near him,\nScrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this\nSpirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\n\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched\nhand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\nsurrounded.\n\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n\n'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said\nScrooge.\n\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n\n'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\nbut will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,\nSpirit?'\n\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\nhe received.\n\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\nrecover.\n\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,\nuncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\nheap of black.\n\n'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre\nI have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope\nto live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your\ncompany, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?'\n\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n\n'Lead on!' said Scrooge. 'Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is\nprecious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!'\n\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in\nthe shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him\nalong.\n\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to\nspring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there they\nwere in the heart of it; on 'Change, amongst the merchants,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Then the shouting and the struggling, and the\nonslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him, with\nchairs for ladders, to dive into his pockets, despoil him of\nbrown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his\nneck, pummel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The\nshouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package\nwas received! The terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in\nthe act of putting a doll's frying pan into his mouth, and was more than\nsuspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden\nplatter! The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy, and\ngratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike. It is enough\nthat, by degrees, the children and their emotions got out of the\nparlour, and, by one stair at a time, up to the top of the house, where\nthey went to bed, and so subsided.\n\nAnd now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of\nthe house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her\nand her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such\nanother creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have\ncalled him father, and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his\nlife, his sight grew very dim indeed.\n\n'Belle,' said the husband, turning to his wife with a smile, 'I saw an\nold friend of yours this afternoon.'\n\n'Who was it?'\n\n'Guess!'\n\n'How can I? Tut, don't I know?' she added in the same breath, laughing\nas he laughed. 'Mr. Scrooge.'\n\n'Mr. Scrooge it was.

His\npartner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat alone.\nQuite alone in the world, I do believe.'\n\n'Spirit!' said Scrooge in a broken voice, 'remove me from this place.'\n\n'I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,' said the\nGhost. 'That they are what they are do not blame me!'\n\n'Remove me!' Scrooge exclaimed, 'I cannot bear it!'\n\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a\nface, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces\nit had shown him, wrestled with it.\n\n'Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!'\n\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost\nwith no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort\nof its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and\nbright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized\nthe extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its\nhead.\n\n[Illustration: _Laden with Christmas toys and presents_]\n\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its\nwhole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he\ncould not hide the light, which streamed from under it, in an unbroken\nflood upon the ground.\n\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible\ndrowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a\nparting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel\nto bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nSTAVE THREE\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS\n\n\nAwaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in\nbed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told\nthat the bell was again upon the stroke of One. He felt that he was\nrestored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial\npurpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to\nhim through Jacob Marley's intervention. But finding that he turned\nuncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this\nnew spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own\nhands, and, lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the\nbed.

'I won't believe it.'\n\nHis colour changed, though, when, without a pause, it came on through\nthe heavy door and passed into the room before his eyes. Upon its coming\nin, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, 'I know him! Marley's\nGhost!' and fell again.\n\nThe same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat,\ntights, and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his\npigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he\ndrew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like\na tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes,\nkeys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His\nbody was transparent: so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking\nthrough his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.\n\nScrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had\nnever believed it until now.\n\nNo, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through\nand through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling\ninfluence of its death-cold eyes, and marked the very texture of the\nfolded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not\nobserved before, he was still incredulous, and fought against his\nsenses.\n\n'How now!' said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. 'What do you want\nwith me?'\n\n'Much!'--Marley's voice; no doubt about it.\n\n'Who are you?'\n\n'Ask me who I _was_.'\n\n'Who _were_ you, then?' said Scrooge, raising his voice. 'You're\nparticular, for a shade.' He was going to say '_to_ a shade,' but\nsubstituted this, as more appropriate.\n\n'In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.'\n\n'Can you--can you sit down?' asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him.\n\n'I can.'\n\n'Do it, then.'\n\nScrooge asked the question, because he didn't know whether a ghost so\ntransparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt\nthat in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the\nnecessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the Ghost sat down on the\nopposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.\n\n'You don't believe in me,' observed the Ghost.\n\n'I don't,' said Scrooge.\n\n'What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your own\nsenses?'\n\n'I don't know,' said Scrooge.\n\n'Why do you doubt your senses?'\n\n'Because,' said Scrooge, 'a little thing affects them. A slight disorder\nof the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef,\na blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato.\nThere's more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!'\n\nScrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel in\nhis heart by any means waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be\nsmart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his\nterror; for the spectre's voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones.\n\nTo sit staring at those fixed, glazed eyes in silence, for a moment,\nwould play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him. There was something\nvery awful, too, in the spectre's being provided with an infernal\natmosphere of his own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was\nclearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its\nhair, and skirts, and tassels were still agitated as by the hot vapour\nfrom an oven.\n\n'You see this toothpick?' said Scrooge, returning quickly to the charge,\nfor the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were only for a\nsecond, to divert the vision's stony gaze from himself.\n\n'I do,' replied the Ghost.\n\n'You are not looking at it,' said Scrooge.\n\n'But I see it,' said the Ghost, 'notwithstanding.'\n\n'Well!' returned Scrooge, 'I have but to swallow this, and be for the\nrest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own\ncreation. Humbug, I tell you: humbug!'\n\nAt this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such\na dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his chair,\nto save himself from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was his\nhorror when the phantom, taking off the bandage round his head, as if it\nwere too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its\nbreast!\n\nScrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.\n\n'Mercy!' he said. 'Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?'\n\n'Man of the worldly mind!' replied"}}

Then old Fezziwig stood\nout to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top couple, too; with a good stiff\npiece of work cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair of\npartners; people who were not to be trifled with; people who would\ndance, and had no notion of walking.\n\nBut if they had been twice as many--ah! four times--old Fezziwig would\nhave been a match for them, and so would Mrs. Fezziwig. As to _her_, she\nwas worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term. If that's not\nhigh praise, tell me higher, and I'll use it. A positive light appeared\nto issue from Fezziwig's calves. They shone in every part of the dance\nlike moons. You couldn't have predicted, at any given time, what would\nbecome of them next. And when old Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone\nall through the dance; advance and retire, both hands to your partner,\nbow and curtsy, cork-screw, thread-the-needle, and back again to your\nplace: Fezziwig 'cut'--cut so deftly, that he appeared to wink with his\nlegs, and came upon his feet again without a stagger.\n\nWhen the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up. Mr. and Mrs.\nFezziwig took their stations, one on either side the door, and, shaking\nhands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him\nor her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the two\n'prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died\naway, and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a counter\nin the back-shop.\n\nDuring the whole of this time Scrooge had acted like a man out of his\nwits. His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self. He\ncorroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and\nunderwent the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the bright\nfaces of his former self and Dick were turned from them, that he\nremembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full upon\nhim, while the light upon its head burnt very clear.\n\n'A small matter,' said the Ghost, 'to make these silly folks so full of\ngratitude.'\n\n'Small!' echoed Scrooge.\n\nThe Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were\npouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig; and when he had done so,\nsaid:\n\n'Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money:\nthree or four, perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves this praise?'\n\n'It isn't that,' said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking\nunconsciously like his former, not his latter self. 'It isn't that,\nSpirit. He has the power to render us happy or unhappy; to make our\nservice light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. Say that his power\nlies in words and looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it\nis impossible to add and count 'em up: what then? The happiness he gives\nis quite as great as if it cost a fortune.'\n\nHe felt the Spirit's glance, and stopped.\n\n'What is the matter?' asked the Ghost.\n\n'Nothing particular,' said Scrooge.\n\n'Something, I think?' the Ghost insisted.\n\n'No,' said Scrooge, 'no. I should like to be able to say a word or two\nto my clerk just now. That's all.'\n\nHis former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish;\nand Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by side in the open air.\n\n'My time grows short,' observed the Spirit. 'Quick!'\n\nThis was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he could see, but\nit produced an immediate effect. For again Scrooge saw himself. He was\nolder now; a man in the prime of life. His face had not the harsh and\nrigid lines of later years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care\nand avarice. There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye,\nwhich showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of\nthe growing tree would fall.\n\nHe was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning\ndress: in whose eyes there were tears, which sparkled in the light that\nshone out of the Ghost of Christmas Past.\n\n'It matters little,' she said softly. 'To you, very little. Another idol\nhas displaced me; and, if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come\nas I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve.'\n\n'What Idol has displaced you?' he rejoined.\n\n'A golden one.'\n\n'This is the even-handed dealing of the world!' he said. 'There is\nnothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is nothing it\nprofesses to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth!'\n\n'You fear the world too much,' she answered gently. 'All your other\nhopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid\nreproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until\nthe master passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?'\n\n'"}}

But how much greater was his\nhorror when the phantom, taking off the bandage round his head, as if it\nwere too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its\nbreast!\n\nScrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.\n\n'Mercy!' he said. 'Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?'\n\n'Man of the worldly mind!' replied the Ghost, 'do you believe in me or\nnot?'\n\n'I do,' said Scrooge; 'I must. But why do spirits walk the earth, and\nwhy do they come to me?'\n\n'It is required of every man,' the Ghost returned, 'that the spirit\nwithin him should walk abroad among his fellow-men, and travel far and\nwide; and, if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do\nso after death. It is doomed to wander through the world--oh, woe is\nme!--and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth,\nand turned to happiness!'\n\nAgain the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its\nshadowy hands.\n\n'You are fettered,' said Scrooge, trembling. 'Tell me why?'\n\n'I wear the chain I forged in life,' replied the Ghost. 'I made it link\nby link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of\nmy own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to _you_?'\n\nScrooge trembled more and more.\n\n'Or would you know,' pursued the Ghost, 'the weight and length of the\nstrong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this\nseven Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it since. It is a\nponderous chain!'\n\nScrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding\nhimself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable; but he\ncould see nothing.\n\n'Jacob!' he said imploringly. 'Old Jacob Marley, tell me more! Speak\ncomfort to me, Jacob!'\n\n'I have none to give,' the Ghost replied. 'It comes from other regions,\nEbenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of\nmen. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all\npermitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere.\nMy spirit never walked beyond our counting-house--mark me;--in life my\nspirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole;\nand weary journeys lie before me!'\n\nIt was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his\nhands in his breeches pockets. Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he\ndid so now, but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his knees.\n\n[Illustration: ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND]\n\n'You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,' Scrooge observed in a\nbusiness-like manner, though with humility and deference.\n\n'Slow!' the Ghost repeated.\n\n'Seven years dead,' mused Scrooge. 'And travelling all the time?'\n\n'The whole time,' said the Ghost. 'No rest, no peace. Incessant torture\nof remorse.'\n\n'You travel fast?' said Scrooge.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'On the wings of the wind,' replied the Ghost.\n\n'You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years,'\nsaid Scrooge.\n\nThe Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its chain so\nhideously in the dead silence of the night, that the Ward would have\nbeen justified in indicting it for a nuisance.\n\n'Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,' cried the phantom, 'not to know\nthat ages of incessant labour, by immortal creatures, for this earth\nmust pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is\nall developed! Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in\nits little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too\nshort for its vast means of usefulness! Not to know that no space of\nregret can make amends for one life's opportunities misused! Yet such\nwas I! Oh, such was I!'\n\n'But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,' faltered Scrooge,\nwho now began to apply this to himself.\n\n'Business!' cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. 'Mankind was my\nbusiness. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy,\nforbearance, and benevolence were, all, my business. The dealings of my\ntrade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my\nbusiness!'\n\nIt held up its chain at arm's-length, as if that were the cause of all\nits unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.\n\n'At this time of the rolling year,' the spectre said, 'I suffer most.\nWhy did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down,\nand never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a\npoor abode? Were there no poor homes to which its light would have\nconducted _me_?'\n\nScrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this\nrate, and began to quake exceedingly.\n\n'Hear me!' cried the Ghost. 'My time is nearly gone.'\n\n'I will,' said Scrooge. 'But don't be hard"}}

For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\nappearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.\n\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being\nacquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time of\nday, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing\nthat they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter;\nbetween which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide\nand comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite\nas hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you to believe that he was\nready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing\nbetween a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\n\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means\nprepared for nothing; and consequently, when the bell struck One, and no\nshape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five\nminutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.\nAll this time he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze\nof ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\nhour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen\nghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at;\nand was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an\ninteresting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the\nconsolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you\nor I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the\npredicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would\nunquestionably have done it too--at last, I say, he began to think that\nthe source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining\nroom, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea\ntaking full possession of his mind, he got up softly, and shuffled in\nhis slippers to the door.\n\nThe moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by\nhis name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.\n\nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone\na surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with\nliving green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which\nbright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe,\nand ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been\nscattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as\nthat dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time,\nor Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the\nfloor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry,\nbrawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,\nmince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,\ncherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense\ntwelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim\nwith their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch there sat a\njolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not\nunlike Plenty's horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on\nScrooge as he came peeping round the door.\n\n'Come in!' exclaimed the Ghost. 'Come in! and know me better, man!'\n\nScrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was\nnot the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit's eyes were\nclear and kind, he did not like to meet them.\n\n'I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,' said the Spirit. 'Look upon me!'\n\nScrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple deep green robe,\nor mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the\nfigure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be\nwarded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the\nample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no\nother covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining\nicicles. Its dark-brown curls were long and free; free as its genial\nface, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its\nunconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was\nan antique scabbard: but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was\neaten up with rust.\n\n'You have never seen the like of me before!' exclaimed the Spirit.\n\n'Never,' Scrooge made answer to it.\n\n'Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning\n(for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?'\npursued the Phantom.\n\n'I don't think I have,' said Scrooge. 'I am afraid I have not. Have"}}

Marley's Ghost, described as having a child-like yet old appearance, exults in the joy and mirth of Christmas, embodying the spirit of the season by spreading cheer and affecting those it encounters, including Scrooge. As a guide, The Ghost takes Scrooge on a journey through time, showing him scenes from his past, present, and potential future. These visions include moments from Scrooge's time with Fezziwig and insights into Tiny Tim's future, playing a pivotal role in prompting Scrooge to reflect on his life, actions, and attitudes. Through these encounters, The Ghost aims to make Scrooge realize the consequences of his actions and attitudes, challenging his worldview and guiding him towards a path of redemption and transformation.

The Ghost takes Scrooge on a journey through his past, allowing him to reflect on and feel emotions about his life choices, highlighting moments that could have led to a different, perhaps happier outcome.\n\nMoreover, The Ghost guides Scrooge through various scenes to witness the joy and warmth of Christmas, aiming to transform his perspective on the holiday and life itself. This includes showing Scrooge visions of the future, notably the fate of Tiny Tim, which deeply affects him and serves as a catalyst for his change of heart. Through these visions, The Ghost not only teaches Scrooge about the spirit of Christmas but also serves as a guide, showing him the consequences of his actions and inactions on those around him.\n\nThe Ghost's interactions with Scrooge are designed to provoke reflection and inspire change, showing him the importance of compassion, empathy, and community. By showing Scrooge visions of his past to inspire change in his present and future, The Ghost plays a crucial role in Scrooge's transformation from a miserly, isolated individual to a person who understands and embraces the spirit of Christmas, ultimately changing his outlook on life and his interactions with others.\",83\n75,\"\"\"SCROOGE\"\"\",\"\"\"THREE SPIRITS\"\"\",\"\"\"The Three Spirits' impending visitation to Scrooge represents his opportunity to alter his fate as forewarned by Marley's Ghost.\"\"\",76\n123,\"\"\"CHRISTMAS\"\"\",\"\"\"THE GHOST\"\"\",\"The Ghost embodies the spirit of Christmas, spreading its values and cheer specifically to Scrooge and the people they encounter together.

Initially characterized by his miserliness, isolation, and a practical, skeptical approach to life, Scrooge's attitude towards Christmas, relationships, and humanity at large undergoes a profound transformation following a series of supernatural visitations. These visitations are from various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and other spectral figures, who guide him through a journey of self-reflection and moral awakening.\n\nThroughout this journey, Scrooge is confronted with different aspects of his life, humanity, and the consequences of his actions. He reflects on his past Christmas experiences with both joy and sorrow, particularly during interactions with the Ghost and his own younger self.

This leads to a moment of realization and a plea for change, as Scrooge fears the world's reproach and sees his nobler aspirations fall off for the pursuit of gain.\n\nDespite his initial reluctance and fear, Scrooge shows curiosity, skepticism, and eventually, a willingness to learn and change. He undergoes a significant transformation, expressing regret for his past actions and a strong desire to change his future. This change is marked by deep emotional responses to the visions shown by the spirits and a newfound understanding of the importance of compassion, generosity, and the Christmas spirit.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Scrooge's transformation becomes evident through his actions.

Employed as a clerk by Mr. Scrooge, Cratchit experiences a range of emotions due to his employer's initial miserliness and subsequent transformation towards generosity. Initially, Cratchit is treated poorly by Scrooge, feared to be late to work, and is concerned about celebrating Christmas under his meager earnings. However, his situation takes a positive turn when Scrooge, influenced by the spirit of Christmas and his own nephew's kindness, decides to give Cratchit the day off for Christmas, an unexpected raise, and even sends a large turkey to Cratchit's dwelling as a gift. This act of generosity is a significant indicator of Scrooge's change of heart.\n\nBob Cratchit's character is a beacon of hope and optimism. Despite his struggles, he remains hopeful and is deeply concerned for the well-being of his family, especially his son Tiny Tim, whom he takes beside him at the dinner table, highlighting his role as a caring and attentive father. Cratchit's modest living conditions are blessed by the Spirit of Christmas Present, further emphasizing the warmth and love that pervade his home, despite financial hardships. Through Cratchit's story, the themes of kindness, generosity, and the importance of family are vividly portrayed, showcasing how his life and that of his family are positively impacted by the transformative journey of his employer, Scrooge.\",13\n9,\"\"\"TINY TIM\"\"\",\"Tiny Tim, the youngest son of Bob Cratchit, is a central figure in \"\"A Christmas Carol,\"\" embodying the struggles and love of the Cratchit family. His health condition is a significant concern for his family, symbolizing the broader themes of hope and the importance of family care within the narrative. Tiny Tim is characterized by his frail health and optimistic spirit, which not only endears him to his family but also serves as a catalyst for Scrooge's transformation. Despite his physical frailty, Tiny Tim is known for his mild and patient demeanor, and his optimistic outlook on life shines as a beacon of hope. His significance extends beyond his immediate family, as he becomes a symbol of the potential for change and goodness in everyone. The story highlights his importance through various interactions, including a poignant conversation between Scrooge and a Ghost, which underscores the uncertainty surrounding Tiny Tim's future. However, Tiny Tim does not die; instead, he benefits from Scrooge's newfound generosity and kindness. Scrooge's transformation is marked by his actions towards the Cratchit family, particularly Tiny Tim, whom he comes to regard as a second father. This relationship underscores the profound impact Tiny Tim has on Scrooge and symbolizes the redemptive power of love and care. Tiny Tim's spirit and memory continue to have a profound impact on his family and on the story's message, emphasizing the significance of compassion and the transformative power of human connection.\",5\n139,\"\"\"MR.

It is mentioned as the destination for the turkey, underscoring its relevance to the story's unfolding events. Additionally, Camden Town holds personal significance for Bob Cratchit, as it is depicted as the place he eagerly runs home to after work on Christmas Eve. This dual mention highlights both its geographical importance and its impact on the characters' lives, particularly Bob Cratchit's, within the narrative context.\",1\n97,\"\"\"PETER CRATCHIT\"\"\",\"Peter Cratchit, one of Bob Cratchit's children, plays a significant role within his family, contributing to discussions and sharing in both their moments of joy and sorrow.

Initially characterized by his miserliness, isolation, and a practical, skeptical approach to life, Scrooge's attitude towards Christmas, relationships, and humanity at large undergoes a profound transformation following a series of supernatural visitations. These visitations are from various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and other spectral figures, who guide him through a journey of self-reflection and moral awakening.\n\nThroughout this journey, Scrooge is confronted with different aspects of his life, humanity, and the consequences of his actions.

This spectral entity first appears to Scrooge to warn him of the impending visitation by Three Spirits, setting the stage for Scrooge's transformative journey. Marley's Ghost, described as having a child-like yet old appearance, exults in the joy and mirth of Christmas, embodying the spirit of the season by spreading cheer and affecting those it encounters, including Scrooge. As a guide, The Ghost takes Scrooge on a journey through time, showing him scenes from his past, present, and potential future. These visions include moments from Scrooge's time with Fezziwig and insights into Tiny Tim's future, playing a pivotal role in prompting Scrooge to reflect on his life, actions, and attitudes. Through these encounters, The Ghost aims to make Scrooge realize the consequences of his actions and attitudes, challenging his worldview and guiding him towards a path of redemption and transformation.

The Ghost takes Scrooge on a journey through his past, allowing him to reflect on and feel emotions about his life choices, highlighting moments that could have led to a different, perhaps happier outcome.\n\nMoreover, The Ghost guides Scrooge through various scenes to witness the joy and warmth of Christmas, aiming to transform his perspective on the holiday and life itself. This includes showing Scrooge visions of the future, notably the fate of Tiny Tim, which deeply affects him and serves as a catalyst for his change of heart. Through these visions, The Ghost not only teaches Scrooge about the spirit of Christmas but also serves as a guide, showing him the consequences of his actions and inactions on those around him.\n\nThe Ghost's interactions with Scrooge are designed to provoke reflection and inspire change, showing him the importance of compassion, empathy, and community.

Initially characterized by his miserliness, isolation, and a practical, skeptical approach to life, Scrooge's attitude towards Christmas, relationships, and humanity at large undergoes a profound transformation following a series of supernatural visitations. These visitations are from various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and other spectral figures, who guide him through a journey of self-reflection and moral awakening.\n\nThroughout this journey, Scrooge is confronted with different aspects of his life, humanity, and the consequences of his actions. He reflects on his past Christmas experiences with both joy and sorrow, particularly during interactions with the Ghost and his own younger self. He witnesses scenes of Christmas cheer, the aftermath of a man's death, and the impact of his own choices on others, including his clerk Bob Cratchit and Cratchit's family. This leads to a moment of realization and a plea for change, as Scrooge fears the world's reproach and sees his nobler aspirations fall off for the pursuit of gain.\n\nDespite his initial reluctance and fear, Scrooge shows curiosity, skepticism, and eventually, a willingness to learn and change. He undergoes a significant transformation, expressing regret for his past actions and a strong desire to change his future. This change is marked by deep emotional responses to the visions shown by the spirits and a newfound understanding of the importance of compassion, generosity, and the Christmas spirit.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Scrooge's transformation becomes evident through his actions. He decides to buy a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engages positively with people on the streets, showing a change in mood and behavior. His transformation is central to the narrative, indirectly affecting the lives of those around him, including the Cratchit family and his nephew.\n\nScrooge's journey from a stingy, hard, and unfeeling man to a better friend, master, and man known for keeping Christmas well illustrates the potential for change and redemption.

Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\n19,\"\"\"SCROOGE\"\"\",\"Scrooge is depicted as a central character known for his miserly and cynical ways, particularly marked by his disdain for Christmas and lack of compassion for the less fortunate. Initially characterized by his miserliness, isolation, and a practical, skeptical approach to life, Scrooge's attitude towards Christmas, relationships, and humanity at large undergoes a profound transformation following a series of supernatural visitations. These visitations are from various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and other spectral figures, who guide him through a journey of self-reflection and moral awakening.\n\nThroughout this journey, Scrooge is confronted with different aspects of his life, humanity, and the consequences of his actions. He reflects on his past Christmas experiences with both joy and sorrow, particularly during interactions with the Ghost and his own younger self. He witnesses scenes of Christmas cheer, the aftermath of a man's death, and the impact of his own choices on others, including his clerk Bob Cratchit and Cratchit's family. This leads to a moment of realization and a plea for change, as Scrooge fears the world's reproach and sees his nobler aspirations fall off for the pursuit of gain.\n\nDespite his initial reluctance and fear, Scrooge shows curiosity, skepticism, and eventually, a willingness to learn and change. He undergoes a significant transformation, expressing regret for his past actions and a strong desire to change his future. This change is marked by deep emotional responses to the visions shown by the spirits and a newfound understanding of the importance of compassion, generosity, and the Christmas spirit.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Scrooge's transformation becomes evident through his actions. He decides to buy a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engages positively with people on the streets, showing a change in mood and behavior. His transformation is central to the narrative, indirectly affecting the lives of those around him, including the Cratchit family and his nephew.\n\nScrooge's journey from a stingy, hard, and unfeeling man to a better friend, master, and man known for keeping Christmas well illustrates the potential for change and redemption. His experiences with the spirits and the profound moment of realization and reflection lead to a significant transformation, making him a symbol of the power of Christmas and human kindness to evoke change and foster a more compassionate and connected society.\",74\n14,\"\"\"JACOB MARLEY\"\"\",\"Jacob Marley is depicted as a pivotal character in the narrative, primarily serving as a catalyst for the transformation of Scrooge. As the ghost of Scrooge's former business partner, Marley's posthumous concern for Scrooge's fate is evident through his intervention from beyond the grave. He is responsible for sending messengers to Scrooge and accurately predicts the visitation of three spirits, actions that underscore his significant role in setting the stage for Scrooge's eventual change of heart. Marley's efforts are recognized by Scrooge, who expresses gratitude towards him for the opportunity to alter his life path. This comprehensive portrayal highlights Marley's integral connection to Scrooge's journey towards redemption.\",2\n23,\"\"\"SCROOGE'S NEPHEW\"\"\",\"Scrooge's nephew, Fred, is the embodiment of the Christmas spirit, contrasting sharply with his uncle Scrooge's skepticism and isolation. Fred is characterized by his cheerful, optimistic nature, and his persistent efforts to share the joy and merriment of the holiday season with Scrooge.

Initially characterized by his miserliness, isolation, and a practical, skeptical approach to life, Scrooge's attitude towards Christmas, relationships, and humanity at large undergoes a profound transformation following a series of supernatural visitations. These visitations are from various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and other spectral figures, who guide him through a journey of self-reflection and moral awakening.\n\nThroughout this journey, Scrooge is confronted with different aspects of his life, humanity, and the consequences of his actions. He reflects on his past Christmas experiences with both joy and sorrow, particularly during interactions with the Ghost and his own younger self. He witnesses scenes of Christmas cheer, the aftermath of a man's death, and the impact of his own choices on others, including his clerk Bob Cratchit and Cratchit's family. This leads to a moment of realization and a plea for change, as Scrooge fears the world's reproach and sees his nobler aspirations fall off for the pursuit of gain.\n\nDespite his initial reluctance and fear, Scrooge shows curiosity, skepticism, and eventually, a willingness to learn and change. He undergoes a significant transformation, expressing regret for his past actions and a strong desire to change his future. This change is marked by deep emotional responses to the visions shown by the spirits and a newfound understanding of the importance of compassion, generosity, and the Christmas spirit.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Scrooge's transformation becomes evident through his actions. He decides to buy a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engages positively with people on the streets, showing a change in mood and behavior. His transformation is central to the narrative, indirectly affecting the lives of those around him, including the Cratchit family and his nephew.\n\nScrooge's journey from a stingy, hard, and unfeeling man to a better friend, master, and man known for keeping Christmas well illustrates the potential for change and redemption.

The nephew's character is defined by his persistent optimism and efforts to persuade Scrooge to embrace the Christmas spirit, showcasing a stark contrast in their attitudes towards the festive season. Despite Scrooge's initial reluctance, his nephew tirelessly attempts to include him in the festivities, demonstrating a deep familial connection and concern for Scrooge's well-being.

Initially characterized by his miserliness, isolation, and a practical, skeptical approach to life, Scrooge's attitude towards Christmas, relationships, and humanity at large undergoes a profound transformation following a series of supernatural visitations. These visitations are from various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and other spectral figures, who guide him through a journey of self-reflection and moral awakening.\n\nThroughout this journey, Scrooge is confronted with different aspects of his life, humanity, and the consequences of his actions. He reflects on his past Christmas experiences with both joy and sorrow, particularly during interactions with the Ghost and his own younger self. He witnesses scenes of Christmas cheer, the aftermath of a man's death, and the impact of his own choices on others, including his clerk Bob Cratchit and Cratchit's family. This leads to a moment of realization and a plea for change, as Scrooge fears the world's reproach and sees his nobler aspirations fall off for the pursuit of gain.\n\nDespite his initial reluctance and fear, Scrooge shows curiosity, skepticism, and eventually, a willingness to learn and change. He undergoes a significant transformation, expressing regret for his past actions and a strong desire to change his future. This change is marked by deep emotional responses to the visions shown by the spirits and a newfound understanding of the importance of compassion, generosity, and the Christmas spirit.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Scrooge's transformation becomes evident through his actions. He decides to buy a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engages positively with people on the streets, showing a change in mood and behavior. His transformation is central to the narrative, indirectly affecting the lives of those around him, including the Cratchit family and his nephew.\n\nScrooge's journey from a stingy, hard, and unfeeling man to a better friend, master, and man known for keeping Christmas well illustrates the potential for change and redemption.

Fred's involvement in a game of Yes and No, which leads to a revelation that the answer is his uncle Scrooge, further highlights his persistent attempts to connect with and understand his uncle.

This spectral entity first appears to Scrooge to warn him of the impending visitation by Three Spirits, setting the stage for Scrooge's transformative journey. Marley's Ghost, described as having a child-like yet old appearance, exults in the joy and mirth of Christmas, embodying the spirit of the season by spreading cheer and affecting those it encounters, including Scrooge. As a guide, The Ghost takes Scrooge on a journey through time, showing him scenes from his past, present, and potential future. These visions include moments from Scrooge's time with Fezziwig and insights into Tiny Tim's future, playing a pivotal role in prompting Scrooge to reflect on his life, actions, and attitudes. Through these encounters, The Ghost aims to make Scrooge realize the consequences of his actions and attitudes, challenging his worldview and guiding him towards a path of redemption and transformation. The Ghost's pleasure in Scrooge's changing mood underscores its role in guiding him towards a better understanding of himself and the spirit of Christmas.\",9\n46,\"\"\"THREE SPIRITS\"\"\",\"\"\"The visitation of Three Spirits is foretold by Marley's Ghost as a chance for Scrooge to change his ways.\"\"\",2\n110,\"\"\"THE LIGHTHOUSE KEEPERS\"\"\",\"\"\"Two men watching the light in a solitary lighthouse, making a fire and wishing each other Merry Christmas, embodying the spirit of the holiday in isolation.\"\"\",2\n49,\"\"\"THE BED CURTAINS\"\"\",\"\"\"The Bed Curtains are a physical location within Scrooge's room, specifically drawn aside by the Ghost to reveal itself.\"\"\",1\n108,\"\"\"THE LAMPLIGHTER\"\"\",\"\"\"The Lamplighter is a character who, despite not knowing of the Ghost's company, laughs out loud as the Spirit passes, contributing to the festive atmosphere.\"\"\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n73,\"\"\"SCROOGE\"\"\",\"\"\"THE GHOST\"\"\",\"Scrooge experiences a profound transformation through his interactions with The Ghost, who plays a pivotal role in his journey towards self-reflection and change. The Ghost personally visits Scrooge, drawing aside the curtains of his bed, marking the beginning of a significant emotional and psychological impact on Scrooge. This visit is not merely a warning but a guided journey through Scrooge's past, present, and future. The Ghost takes Scrooge on a journey through his past, allowing him to reflect on and feel emotions about his life choices, highlighting moments that could have led to a different, perhaps happier outcome.\n\nMoreover, The Ghost guides Scrooge through various scenes to witness the joy and warmth of Christmas, aiming to transform his perspective on the holiday and life itself. This includes showing Scrooge visions of the future, notably the fate of Tiny Tim, which deeply affects him and serves as a catalyst for his change of heart. Through these visions, The Ghost not only teaches Scrooge about the spirit of Christmas but also serves as a guide, showing him the consequences of his actions and inactions on those around him.\n\nThe Ghost's interactions with Scrooge are designed to provoke reflection and inspire change, showing him the importance of compassion, empathy, and community. By showing Scrooge visions of his past to inspire change in his present and future, The Ghost plays a crucial role in Scrooge's transformation from a miserly, isolated individual to a person who understands and embraces the spirit of Christmas, ultimately changing his outlook on life and his interactions with others.\",83\n75,\"\"\"SCROOGE\"\"\",\"\"\"THREE SPIRITS\"\"\",\"\"\"The Three Spirits' impending visitation to Scrooge represents his opportunity to alter his fate as forewarned by Marley's Ghost.\"\"\",76\n123,\"\"\"CHRISTMAS\"\"\",\"\"\"THE GHOST\"\"\",\"The Ghost embodies the spirit of Christmas, spreading its values and cheer specifically to Scrooge and the people they encounter together.

Initially characterized by his miserliness, isolation, and a practical, skeptical approach to life, Scrooge's attitude towards Christmas, relationships, and humanity at large undergoes a profound transformation following a series of supernatural visitations. These visitations are from various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and other spectral figures, who guide him through a journey of self-reflection and moral awakening.\n\nThroughout this journey, Scrooge is confronted with different aspects of his life, humanity, and the consequences of his actions. He reflects on his past Christmas experiences with both joy and sorrow, particularly during interactions with the Ghost and his own younger self. He witnesses scenes of Christmas cheer, the aftermath of a man's death, and the impact of his own choices on others, including his clerk Bob Cratchit and Cratchit's family. This leads to a moment of realization and a plea for change, as Scrooge fears the world's reproach and sees his nobler aspirations fall off for the pursuit of gain.\n\nDespite his initial reluctance and fear, Scrooge shows curiosity, skepticism, and eventually, a willingness to learn and change. He undergoes a significant transformation, expressing regret for his past actions and a strong desire to change his future. This change is marked by deep emotional responses to the visions shown by the spirits and a newfound understanding of the importance of compassion, generosity, and the Christmas spirit.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Scrooge's transformation becomes evident through his actions. He decides to buy a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engages positively with people on the streets, showing a change in mood and behavior. His transformation is central to the narrative, indirectly affecting the lives of those around him, including the Cratchit family and his nephew.\n\nScrooge's journey from a stingy, hard, and unfeeling man to a better friend, master, and man known for keeping Christmas well illustrates the potential for change and redemption. His experiences with the spirits and the profound moment of realization and reflection lead to a significant transformation, making him a symbol of the power of Christmas and human kindness to evoke change and foster a more compassionate and connected society.\",74\n14,\"\"\"JACOB MARLEY\"\"\",\"Jacob Marley is depicted as a pivotal character in the narrative, primarily serving as a catalyst for the transformation of Scrooge. As the ghost of Scrooge's former business partner, Marley's posthumous concern for Scrooge's fate is evident through his intervention from beyond the grave. He is responsible for sending messengers to Scrooge and accurately predicts the visitation of three spirits, actions that underscore his significant role in setting the stage for Scrooge's eventual change of heart. Marley's efforts are recognized by Scrooge, who expresses gratitude towards him for the opportunity to alter his life path. This comprehensive portrayal highlights Marley's integral connection to Scrooge's journey towards redemption.\",2\n23,\"\"\"SCROOGE'S NEPHEW\"\"\",\"Scrooge's nephew, Fred, is the embodiment of the Christmas spirit, contrasting sharply with his uncle Scrooge's skepticism and isolation.

He is depicted as a jovial and optimistic character, who not only encourages merriment but also expresses pity for his uncle's bitterness and isolation, especially during Christmas. Fred's involvement in a game of Yes and No, which leads to a revelation that the answer is his uncle Scrooge, further highlights his persistent attempts to connect with and understand his uncle.

This spectral entity first appears to Scrooge to warn him of the impending visitation by Three Spirits, setting the stage for Scrooge's transformative journey. Marley's Ghost, described as having a child-like yet old appearance, exults in the joy and mirth of Christmas, embodying the spirit of the season by spreading cheer and affecting those it encounters, including Scrooge. As a guide, The Ghost takes Scrooge on a journey through time, showing him scenes from his past, present, and potential future. These visions include moments from Scrooge's time with Fezziwig and insights into Tiny Tim's future, playing a pivotal role in prompting Scrooge to reflect on his life, actions, and attitudes. Through these encounters, The Ghost aims to make Scrooge realize the consequences of his actions and attitudes, challenging his worldview and guiding him towards a path of redemption and transformation. The Ghost's pleasure in Scrooge's changing mood underscores its role in guiding him towards a better understanding of himself and the spirit of Christmas.\",9\n46,\"\"\"THREE SPIRITS\"\"\",\"\"\"The visitation of Three Spirits is foretold by Marley's Ghost as a chance for Scrooge to change his ways.\"\"\",2\n110,\"\"\"THE LIGHTHOUSE KEEPERS\"\"\",\"\"\"Two men watching the light in a solitary lighthouse, making a fire and wishing each other Merry Christmas, embodying the spirit of the holiday in isolation.\"\"\",2\n49,\"\"\"THE BED CURTAINS\"\"\",\"\"\"The Bed Curtains are a physical location within Scrooge's room, specifically drawn aside by the Ghost to reveal itself.\"\"\",1\n108,\"\"\"THE LAMPLIGHTER\"\"\",\"\"\"The Lamplighter is a character who, despite not knowing of the Ghost's company, laughs out loud as the Spirit passes, contributing to the festive atmosphere.\"\"\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n73,\"\"\"SCROOGE\"\"\",\"\"\"THE GHOST\"\"\",\"Scrooge experiences a profound transformation through his interactions with The Ghost, who plays a pivotal role in his journey towards self-reflection and change. The Ghost personally visits Scrooge, drawing aside the curtains of his bed, marking the beginning of a significant emotional and psychological impact on Scrooge. This visit is not merely a warning but a guided journey through Scrooge's past, present, and future. The Ghost takes Scrooge on a journey through his past, allowing him to reflect on and feel emotions about his life choices, highlighting moments that could have led to a different, perhaps happier outcome.\n\nMoreover, The Ghost guides Scrooge through various scenes to witness the joy and warmth of Christmas, aiming to transform his perspective on the holiday and life itself. This includes showing Scrooge visions of the future, notably the fate of Tiny Tim, which deeply affects him and serves as a catalyst for his change of heart. Through these visions, The Ghost not only teaches Scrooge about the spirit of Christmas but also serves as a guide, showing him the consequences of his actions and inactions on those around him.\n\nThe Ghost's interactions with Scrooge are designed to provoke reflection and inspire change, showing him the importance of compassion, empathy, and community. By showing Scrooge visions of his past to inspire change in his present and future, The Ghost plays a crucial role in Scrooge's transformation from a miserly, isolated individual to a person who understands and embraces the spirit of Christmas, ultimately changing his outlook on life and his interactions with others.\",83\n75,\"\"\"SCROOGE\"\"\",\"\"\"THREE SPIRITS\"\"\",\"\"\"The Three Spirits' impending visitation to Scrooge represents his opportunity to alter his fate as forewarned by Marley's Ghost.\"\"\",76\n123,\"\"\"CHRISTMAS\"\"\",\"\"\"THE GHOST\"\"\",\"The Ghost embodies the spirit of Christmas, spreading its values and cheer specifically to Scrooge and the people they encounter together.

Initially characterized by his miserliness, isolation, and a practical, skeptical approach to life, Scrooge's attitude towards Christmas, relationships, and humanity at large undergoes a profound transformation following a series of supernatural visitations. These visitations are from various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and other spectral figures, who guide him through a journey of self-reflection and moral awakening.\n\nThroughout this journey, Scrooge is confronted with different aspects of his life, humanity, and the consequences of his actions. He reflects on his past Christmas experiences with both joy and sorrow, particularly during interactions with the Ghost and his own younger self. He witnesses scenes of Christmas cheer, the aftermath of a man's death, and the impact of his own choices on others, including his clerk Bob Cratchit and Cratchit's family. This leads to a moment of realization and a plea for change, as Scrooge fears the world's reproach and sees his nobler aspirations fall off for the pursuit of gain.\n\nDespite his initial reluctance and fear, Scrooge shows curiosity, skepticism, and eventually, a willingness to learn and change. He undergoes a significant transformation, expressing regret for his past actions and a strong desire to change his future. This change is marked by deep emotional responses to the visions shown by the spirits and a newfound understanding of the importance of compassion, generosity, and the Christmas spirit.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Scrooge's transformation becomes evident through his actions.

This spectral entity first appears to Scrooge to warn him of the impending visitation by Three Spirits, setting the stage for Scrooge's transformative journey. Marley's Ghost, described as having a child-like yet old appearance, exults in the joy and mirth of Christmas, embodying the spirit of the season by spreading cheer and affecting those it encounters, including Scrooge. As a guide, The Ghost takes Scrooge on a journey through time, showing him scenes from his past, present, and potential future. These visions include moments from Scrooge's time with Fezziwig and insights into Tiny Tim's future, playing a pivotal role in prompting Scrooge to reflect on his life, actions, and attitudes. Through these encounters, The Ghost aims to make Scrooge realize the consequences of his actions and attitudes, challenging his worldview and guiding him towards a path of redemption and transformation. The Ghost's pleasure in Scrooge's changing mood underscores its role in guiding him towards a better understanding of himself and the spirit of Christmas.\",9\n46,\"\"\"THREE SPIRITS\"\"\",\"\"\"The visitation of Three Spirits is foretold by Marley's Ghost as a chance for Scrooge to change his ways.\"\"\",2\n110,\"\"\"THE LIGHTHOUSE KEEPERS\"\"\",\"\"\"Two men watching the light in a solitary lighthouse, making a fire and wishing each other Merry Christmas, embodying the spirit of the holiday in isolation.\"\"\",2\n49,\"\"\"THE BED CURTAINS\"\"\",\"\"\"The Bed Curtains are a physical location within Scrooge's room, specifically drawn aside by the Ghost to reveal itself.\"\"\",1\n108,\"\"\"THE LAMPLIGHTER\"\"\",\"\"\"The Lamplighter is a character who, despite not knowing of the Ghost's company, laughs out loud as the Spirit passes, contributing to the festive atmosphere.\"\"\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n73,\"\"\"SCROOGE\"\"\",\"\"\"THE GHOST\"\"\",\"Scrooge experiences a profound transformation through his interactions with The Ghost, who plays a pivotal role in his journey towards self-reflection and change. The Ghost personally visits Scrooge, drawing aside the curtains of his bed, marking the beginning of a significant emotional and psychological impact on Scrooge. This visit is not merely a warning but a guided journey through Scrooge's past, present, and future. The Ghost takes Scrooge on a journey through his past, allowing him to reflect on and feel emotions about his life choices, highlighting moments that could have led to a different, perhaps happier outcome.\n\nMoreover, The Ghost guides Scrooge through various scenes to witness the joy and warmth of Christmas, aiming to transform his perspective on the holiday and life itself. This includes showing Scrooge visions of the future, notably the fate of Tiny Tim, which deeply affects him and serves as a catalyst for his change of heart. Through these visions, The Ghost not only teaches Scrooge about the spirit of Christmas but also serves as a guide, showing him the consequences of his actions and inactions on those around him.\n\nThe Ghost's interactions with Scrooge are designed to provoke reflection and inspire change, showing him the importance of compassion, empathy, and community. By showing Scrooge visions of his past to inspire change in his present and future, The Ghost plays a crucial role in Scrooge's transformation from a miserly, isolated individual to a person who understands and embraces the spirit of Christmas, ultimately changing his outlook on life and his interactions with others.\",83\n75,\"\"\"SCROOGE\"\"\",\"\"\"THREE SPIRITS\"\"\",\"\"\"The Three Spirits' impending visitation to Scrooge represents his opportunity to alter his fate as forewarned by Marley's Ghost.\"\"\",76\n123,\"\"\"CHRISTMAS\"\"\",\"\"\"THE GHOST\"\"\",\"The Ghost embodies the spirit of Christmas, spreading its values and cheer specifically to Scrooge and the people they encounter together.

Initially characterized by his miserliness, isolation, and a practical, skeptical approach to life, Scrooge's attitude towards Christmas, relationships, and humanity at large undergoes a profound transformation following a series of supernatural visitations. These visitations are from various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and other spectral figures, who guide him through a journey of self-reflection and moral awakening.\n\nThroughout this journey, Scrooge is confronted with different aspects of his life, humanity, and the consequences of his actions. He reflects on his past Christmas experiences with both joy and sorrow, particularly during interactions with the Ghost and his own younger self. He witnesses scenes of Christmas cheer, the aftermath of a man's death, and the impact of his own choices on others, including his clerk Bob Cratchit and Cratchit's family. This leads to a moment of realization and a plea for change, as Scrooge fears the world's reproach and sees his nobler aspirations fall off for the pursuit of gain.\n\nDespite his initial reluctance and fear, Scrooge shows curiosity, skepticism, and eventually, a willingness to learn and change. He undergoes a significant transformation, expressing regret for his past actions and a strong desire to change his future. This change is marked by deep emotional responses to the visions shown by the spirits and a newfound understanding of the importance of compassion, generosity, and the Christmas spirit.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Scrooge's transformation becomes evident through his actions.

This spectral entity first appears to Scrooge to warn him of the impending visitation by Three Spirits, setting the stage for Scrooge's transformative journey. Marley's Ghost, described as having a child-like yet old appearance, exults in the joy and mirth of Christmas, embodying the spirit of the season by spreading cheer and affecting those it encounters, including Scrooge. As a guide, The Ghost takes Scrooge on a journey through time, showing him scenes from his past, present, and potential future. These visions include moments from Scrooge's time with Fezziwig and insights into Tiny Tim's future, playing a pivotal role in prompting Scrooge to reflect on his life, actions, and attitudes. Through these encounters, The Ghost aims to make Scrooge realize the consequences of his actions and attitudes, challenging his worldview and guiding him towards a path of redemption and transformation. The Ghost's pleasure in Scrooge's changing mood underscores its role in guiding him towards a better understanding of himself and the spirit of Christmas.\",9\n46,\"\"\"THREE SPIRITS\"\"\",\"\"\"The visitation of Three Spirits is foretold by Marley's Ghost as a chance for Scrooge to change his ways.\"\"\",2\n110,\"\"\"THE LIGHTHOUSE KEEPERS\"\"\",\"\"\"Two men watching the light in a solitary lighthouse, making a fire and wishing each other Merry Christmas, embodying the spirit of the holiday in isolation.\"\"\",2\n49,\"\"\"THE BED CURTAINS\"\"\",\"\"\"The Bed Curtains are a physical location within Scrooge's room, specifically drawn aside by the Ghost to reveal itself.\"\"\",1\n108,\"\"\"THE LAMPLIGHTER\"\"\",\"\"\"The Lamplighter is a character who, despite not knowing of the Ghost's company, laughs out loud as the Spirit passes, contributing to the festive atmosphere.\"\"\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n73,\"\"\"SCROOGE\"\"\",\"\"\"THE GHOST\"\"\",\"Scrooge experiences a profound transformation through his interactions with The Ghost, who plays a pivotal role in his journey towards self-reflection and change. The Ghost personally visits Scrooge, drawing aside the curtains of his bed, marking the beginning of a significant emotional and psychological impact on Scrooge. This visit is not merely a warning but a guided journey through Scrooge's past, present, and future. The Ghost takes Scrooge on a journey through his past, allowing him to reflect on and feel emotions about his life choices, highlighting moments that could have led to a different, perhaps happier outcome.\n\nMoreover, The Ghost guides Scrooge through various scenes to witness the joy and warmth of Christmas, aiming to transform his perspective on the holiday and life itself. This includes showing Scrooge visions of the future, notably the fate of Tiny Tim, which deeply affects him and serves as a catalyst for his change of heart. Through these visions, The Ghost not only teaches Scrooge about the spirit of Christmas but also serves as a guide, showing him the consequences of his actions and inactions on those around him.\n\nThe Ghost's interactions with Scrooge are designed to provoke reflection and inspire change, showing him the importance of compassion, empathy, and community. By showing Scrooge visions of his past to inspire change in his present and future, The Ghost plays a crucial role in Scrooge's transformation from a miserly, isolated individual to a person who understands and embraces the spirit of Christmas, ultimately changing his outlook on life and his interactions with others.\",83\n75,\"\"\"SCROOGE\"\"\",\"\"\"THREE SPIRITS\"\"\",\"\"\"The Three Spirits' impending visitation to Scrooge represents his opportunity to alter his fate as forewarned by Marley's Ghost.\"\"\",76\n123,\"\"\"CHRISTMAS\"\"\",\"\"\"THE GHOST\"\"\",\"The Ghost embodies the spirit of Christmas, spreading its values and cheer specifically to Scrooge and the people they encounter together.

Initially characterized by his miserliness, isolation, and a practical, skeptical approach to life, Scrooge's attitude towards Christmas, relationships, and humanity at large undergoes a profound transformation following a series of supernatural visitations. These visitations are from various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and other spectral figures, who guide him through a journey of self-reflection and moral awakening.\n\nThroughout this journey, Scrooge is confronted with different aspects of his life, humanity, and the consequences of his actions. He reflects on his past Christmas experiences with both joy and sorrow, particularly during interactions with the Ghost and his own younger self. He witnesses scenes of Christmas cheer, the aftermath of a man's death, and the impact of his own choices on others, including his clerk Bob Cratchit and Cratchit's family. This leads to a moment of realization and a plea for change, as Scrooge fears the world's reproach and sees his nobler aspirations fall off for the pursuit of gain.\n\nDespite his initial reluctance and fear, Scrooge shows curiosity, skepticism, and eventually, a willingness to learn and change. He undergoes a significant transformation, expressing regret for his past actions and a strong desire to change his future. This change is marked by deep emotional responses to the visions shown by the spirits and a newfound understanding of the importance of compassion, generosity, and the Christmas spirit.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Scrooge's transformation becomes evident through his actions. He decides to buy a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engages positively with people on the streets, showing a change in mood and behavior. His transformation is central to the narrative, indirectly affecting the lives of those around him, including the Cratchit family and his nephew.\n\nScrooge's journey from a stingy, hard, and unfeeling man to a better friend, master, and man known for keeping Christmas well illustrates the potential for change and redemption. His experiences with the spirits and the profound moment of realization and reflection lead to a significant transformation, making him a symbol of the power of Christmas and human kindness to evoke change and foster a more compassionate and connected society.\",74\n14,\"\"\"JACOB MARLEY\"\"\",\"Jacob Marley is depicted as a pivotal character in the narrative, primarily serving as a catalyst for the transformation of Scrooge.

Marley's efforts are recognized by Scrooge, who expresses gratitude towards him for the opportunity to alter his life path. This comprehensive portrayal highlights Marley's integral connection to Scrooge's journey towards redemption.\",2\n23,\"\"\"SCROOGE'S NEPHEW\"\"\",\"Scrooge's nephew, Fred, is the embodiment of the Christmas spirit, contrasting sharply with his uncle Scrooge's skepticism and isolation.

He is depicted as a jovial and optimistic character, who not only encourages merriment but also expresses pity for his uncle's bitterness and isolation, especially during Christmas. Fred's involvement in a game of Yes and No, which leads to a revelation that the answer is his uncle Scrooge, further highlights his persistent attempts to connect with and understand his uncle.

Marley's Ghost, described as having a child-like yet old appearance, exults in the joy and mirth of Christmas, embodying the spirit of the season by spreading cheer and affecting those it encounters, including Scrooge. As a guide, The Ghost takes Scrooge on a journey through time, showing him scenes from his past, present, and potential future. These visions include moments from Scrooge's time with Fezziwig and insights into Tiny Tim's future, playing a pivotal role in prompting Scrooge to reflect on his life, actions, and attitudes. Through these encounters, The Ghost aims to make Scrooge realize the consequences of his actions and attitudes, challenging his worldview and guiding him towards a path of redemption and transformation.

The Ghost takes Scrooge on a journey through his past, allowing him to reflect on and feel emotions about his life choices, highlighting moments that could have led to a different, perhaps happier outcome.\n\nMoreover, The Ghost guides Scrooge through various scenes to witness the joy and warmth of Christmas, aiming to transform his perspective on the holiday and life itself.

Through these visions, The Ghost not only teaches Scrooge about the spirit of Christmas but also serves as a guide, showing him the consequences of his actions and inactions on those around him.\n\nThe Ghost's interactions with Scrooge are designed to provoke reflection and inspire change, showing him the importance of compassion, empathy, and community.

Initially characterized by his miserliness, isolation, and a practical, skeptical approach to life, Scrooge's attitude towards Christmas, relationships, and humanity at large undergoes a profound transformation following a series of supernatural visitations. These visitations are from various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and other spectral figures, who guide him through a journey of self-reflection and moral awakening.\n\nThroughout this journey, Scrooge is confronted with different aspects of his life, humanity, and the consequences of his actions. He reflects on his past Christmas experiences with both joy and sorrow, particularly during interactions with the Ghost and his own younger self. He witnesses scenes of Christmas cheer, the aftermath of a man's death, and the impact of his own choices on others, including his clerk Bob Cratchit and Cratchit's family. This leads to a moment of realization and a plea for change, as Scrooge fears the world's reproach and sees his nobler aspirations fall off for the pursuit of gain.\n\nDespite his initial reluctance and fear, Scrooge shows curiosity, skepticism, and eventually, a willingness to learn and change. He undergoes a significant transformation, expressing regret for his past actions and a strong desire to change his future. This change is marked by deep emotional responses to the visions shown by the spirits and a newfound understanding of the importance of compassion, generosity, and the Christmas spirit.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Scrooge's transformation becomes evident through his actions. He decides to buy a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engages positively with people on the streets, showing a change in mood and behavior. His transformation is central to the narrative, indirectly affecting the lives of those around him, including the Cratchit family and his nephew.\n\nScrooge's journey from a stingy, hard, and unfeeling man to a better friend, master, and man known for keeping Christmas well illustrates the potential for change and redemption. His experiences with the spirits and the profound moment of realization and reflection lead to a significant transformation, making him a symbol of the power of Christmas and human kindness to evoke change and foster a more compassionate and connected society.\",74\n11,\"\"\"GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST\"\"\",\"The Ghost of Christmas Past is a spectral figure that visits Scrooge to show him scenes from his past.

Marley's efforts are recognized by Scrooge, who expresses gratitude towards him for the opportunity to alter his life path. This comprehensive portrayal highlights Marley's integral connection to Scrooge's journey towards redemption.\",2\n20,\"\"\"MARLEY\"\"\",\"Marley, who is consistently referenced as a deceased individual, was Scrooge's former business partner and has been dead for seven years.

Fred's involvement in a game of Yes and No, which leads to a revelation that the answer is his uncle Scrooge, further highlights his persistent attempts to connect with and understand his uncle.

Initially characterized by his miserliness, isolation, and a practical, skeptical approach to life, Scrooge's attitude towards Christmas, relationships, and humanity at large undergoes a profound transformation following a series of supernatural visitations. These visitations are from various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and other spectral figures, who guide him through a journey of self-reflection and moral awakening.\n\nThroughout this journey, Scrooge is confronted with different aspects of his life, humanity, and the consequences of his actions. He reflects on his past Christmas experiences with both joy and sorrow, particularly during interactions with the Ghost and his own younger self. He witnesses scenes of Christmas cheer, the aftermath of a man's death, and the impact of his own choices on others, including his clerk Bob Cratchit and Cratchit's family. This leads to a moment of realization and a plea for change, as Scrooge fears the world's reproach and sees his nobler aspirations fall off for the pursuit of gain.\n\nDespite his initial reluctance and fear, Scrooge shows curiosity, skepticism, and eventually, a willingness to learn and change. He undergoes a significant transformation, expressing regret for his past actions and a strong desire to change his future. This change is marked by deep emotional responses to the visions shown by the spirits and a newfound understanding of the importance of compassion, generosity, and the Christmas spirit.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Scrooge's transformation becomes evident through his actions.

Initially characterized by his miserliness, isolation, and a practical, skeptical approach to life, Scrooge's attitude towards Christmas, relationships, and humanity at large undergoes a profound transformation following a series of supernatural visitations. These visitations are from various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and other spectral figures, who guide him through a journey of self-reflection and moral awakening.\n\nThroughout this journey, Scrooge is confronted with different aspects of his life, humanity, and the consequences of his actions. He reflects on his past Christmas experiences with both joy and sorrow, particularly during interactions with the Ghost and his own younger self. He witnesses scenes of Christmas cheer, the aftermath of a man's death, and the impact of his own choices on others, including his clerk Bob Cratchit and Cratchit's family. This leads to a moment of realization and a plea for change, as Scrooge fears the world's reproach and sees his nobler aspirations fall off for the pursuit of gain.\n\nDespite his initial reluctance and fear, Scrooge shows curiosity, skepticism, and eventually, a willingness to learn and change. He undergoes a significant transformation, expressing regret for his past actions and a strong desire to change his future. This change is marked by deep emotional responses to the visions shown by the spirits and a newfound understanding of the importance of compassion, generosity, and the Christmas spirit.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Scrooge's transformation becomes evident through his actions.

Initially characterized by his miserliness, isolation, and a practical, skeptical approach to life, Scrooge's attitude towards Christmas, relationships, and humanity at large undergoes a profound transformation following a series of supernatural visitations. These visitations are from various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and other spectral figures, who guide him through a journey of self-reflection and moral awakening.\n\nThroughout this journey, Scrooge is confronted with different aspects of his life, humanity, and the consequences of his actions. He reflects on his past Christmas experiences with both joy and sorrow, particularly during interactions with the Ghost and his own younger self. He witnesses scenes of Christmas cheer, the aftermath of a man's death, and the impact of his own choices on others, including his clerk Bob Cratchit and Cratchit's family. This leads to a moment of realization and a plea for change, as Scrooge fears the world's reproach and sees his nobler aspirations fall off for the pursuit of gain.\n\nDespite his initial reluctance and fear, Scrooge shows curiosity, skepticism, and eventually, a willingness to learn and change. He undergoes a significant transformation, expressing regret for his past actions and a strong desire to change his future. This change is marked by deep emotional responses to the visions shown by the spirits and a newfound understanding of the importance of compassion, generosity, and the Christmas spirit.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Scrooge's transformation becomes evident through his actions.

Initially characterized by his miserliness, isolation, and a practical, skeptical approach to life, Scrooge's attitude towards Christmas, relationships, and humanity at large undergoes a profound transformation following a series of supernatural visitations. These visitations are from various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and other spectral figures, who guide him through a journey of self-reflection and moral awakening.\n\nThroughout this journey, Scrooge is confronted with different aspects of his life, humanity, and the consequences of his actions. He reflects on his past Christmas experiences with both joy and sorrow, particularly during interactions with the Ghost and his own younger self. He witnesses scenes of Christmas cheer, the aftermath of a man's death, and the impact of his own choices on others, including his clerk Bob Cratchit and Cratchit's family. This leads to a moment of realization and a plea for change, as Scrooge fears the world's reproach and sees his nobler aspirations fall off for the pursuit of gain.\n\nDespite his initial reluctance and fear, Scrooge shows curiosity, skepticism, and eventually, a willingness to learn and change. He undergoes a significant transformation, expressing regret for his past actions and a strong desire to change his future. This change is marked by deep emotional responses to the visions shown by the spirits and a newfound understanding of the importance of compassion, generosity, and the Christmas spirit.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Scrooge's transformation becomes evident through his actions. He decides to buy a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engages positively with people on the streets, showing a change in mood and behavior. His transformation is central to the narrative, indirectly affecting the lives of those around him, including the Cratchit family and his nephew.\n\nScrooge's journey from a stingy, hard, and unfeeling man to a better friend, master, and man known for keeping Christmas well illustrates the potential for change and redemption. His experiences with the spirits and the profound moment of realization and reflection lead to a significant transformation, making him a symbol of the power of Christmas and human kindness to evoke change and foster a more compassionate and connected society.\",74\n11,\"\"\"GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST\"\"\",\"The Ghost of Christmas Past is a spectral figure that visits Scrooge to show him scenes from his past. This phantom aims to prompt Scrooge to reflect on his life choices and the impact they have had on himself and others. By presenting these vivid recollections, the spirit seeks to encourage Scrooge to consider the path his life has taken and the potential for change. This encounter is characterized by the ghost's ability to transport Scrooge back in time, allowing him to witness firsthand the moments that have shaped his current disposition and outlook on life.\",3\n29,\"\"\"THE GENTLEMAN\"\"\",\"\"\"The Gentleman is a character who approaches Scrooge with the intention of raising funds to provide for the poor during the festive season.\"\"\",3\n126,\"\"\"GREAT FAT MAN\"\"\",,2\n14,\"\"\"JACOB MARLEY\"\"\",\"Jacob Marley is depicted as a pivotal character in the narrative, primarily serving as a catalyst for the transformation of Scrooge. As the ghost of Scrooge's former business partner, Marley's posthumous concern for Scrooge's fate is evident through his intervention from beyond the grave. He is responsible for sending messengers to Scrooge and accurately predicts the visitation of three spirits, actions that underscore his significant role in setting the stage for Scrooge's eventual change of heart. Marley's efforts are recognized by Scrooge, who expresses gratitude towards him for the opportunity to alter his life path. This comprehensive portrayal highlights Marley's integral connection to Scrooge's journey towards redemption.\",2\n20,\"\"\"MARLEY\"\"\",\"Marley, who is consistently referenced as a deceased individual, was Scrooge's former business partner and has been dead for seven years. His presence and past actions have a significant and lingering effect on Scrooge, indicating a deep connection between the two. This connection is further emphasized by Marley's appearance as a supernatural phenomenon on Scrooge's door knocker, symbolizing his ongoing presence in Scrooge's life. The fact that Marley, now a ghost, was Scrooge's business partner establishes the premise for the ghostly events that follow in the narrative, highlighting the intertwined fates of Marley and Scrooge.\",2\n122,\"\"\"PHANTOM\"\"\",\"The Phantom is a spectral figure that plays a crucial role in guiding Scrooge on his transformative journey. This entity serves as both a silent observer and a catalyst for Scrooge's reflections, showing him a series of scenes that are highly relevant to his life and moral development. Through these scenes, The Phantom imparts lessons of morality and consequence, effectively serving as a bridge between Scrooge's past, present, and potential future. The Phantom's guidance is instrumental in Scrooge's realization and understanding of the impact of his actions, leading him towards a path of redemption.\",2\n124,\"\"\"RED-FACED GENTLEMAN\"\"\",\"\"\"A red-faced gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on his nose, interested in the deceased's money and the funeral arrangements.\"\"\",2\n21,\"\"\"SCROOGE AND MARLEY\"\"\",\"\"\"Scrooge and Marley is the name of the business firm, indicating its significance in the story and its association with both Scrooge and Marley.\"\"\",2\n23,\"\"\"SCROOGE'S NEPHEW\"\"\",\"Scrooge's nephew, Fred, is the embodiment of the Christmas spirit, contrasting sharply with his uncle Scrooge's skepticism and isolation. Fred is characterized by his cheerful, optimistic nature, and his persistent efforts to share the joy and merriment of the holiday season with Scrooge.

Initially characterized by his miserliness, isolation, and a practical, skeptical approach to life, Scrooge's attitude towards Christmas, relationships, and humanity at large undergoes a profound transformation following a series of supernatural visitations. These visitations are from various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and other spectral figures, who guide him through a journey of self-reflection and moral awakening.\n\nThroughout this journey, Scrooge is confronted with different aspects of his life, humanity, and the consequences of his actions. He reflects on his past Christmas experiences with both joy and sorrow, particularly during interactions with the Ghost and his own younger self. He witnesses scenes of Christmas cheer, the aftermath of a man's death, and the impact of his own choices on others, including his clerk Bob Cratchit and Cratchit's family. This leads to a moment of realization and a plea for change, as Scrooge fears the world's reproach and sees his nobler aspirations fall off for the pursuit of gain.\n\nDespite his initial reluctance and fear, Scrooge shows curiosity, skepticism, and eventually, a willingness to learn and change. He undergoes a significant transformation, expressing regret for his past actions and a strong desire to change his future. This change is marked by deep emotional responses to the visions shown by the spirits and a newfound understanding of the importance of compassion, generosity, and the Christmas spirit.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Scrooge's transformation becomes evident through his actions. He decides to buy a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engages positively with people on the streets, showing a change in mood and behavior. His transformation is central to the narrative, indirectly affecting the lives of those around him, including the Cratchit family and his nephew.\n\nScrooge's journey from a stingy, hard, and unfeeling man to a better friend, master, and man known for keeping Christmas well illustrates the potential for change and redemption. His experiences with the spirits and the profound moment of realization and reflection lead to a significant transformation, making him a symbol of the power of Christmas and human kindness to evoke change and foster a more compassionate and connected society.\",74\n11,\"\"\"GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST\"\"\",\"The Ghost of Christmas Past is a spectral figure that visits Scrooge to show him scenes from his past. This phantom aims to prompt Scrooge to reflect on his life choices and the impact they have had on himself and others. By presenting these vivid recollections, the spirit seeks to encourage Scrooge to consider the path his life has taken and the potential for change. This encounter is characterized by the ghost's ability to transport Scrooge back in time, allowing him to witness firsthand the moments that have shaped his current disposition and outlook on life.\",3\n29,\"\"\"THE GENTLEMAN\"\"\",\"\"\"The Gentleman is a character who approaches Scrooge with the intention of raising funds to provide for the poor during the festive season.\"\"\",3\n126,\"\"\"GREAT FAT MAN\"\"\",,2\n14,\"\"\"JACOB MARLEY\"\"\",\"Jacob Marley is depicted as a pivotal character in the narrative, primarily serving as a catalyst for the transformation of Scrooge. As the ghost of Scrooge's former business partner, Marley's posthumous concern for Scrooge's fate is evident through his intervention from beyond the grave. He is responsible for sending messengers to Scrooge and accurately predicts the visitation of three spirits, actions that underscore his significant role in setting the stage for Scrooge's eventual change of heart. Marley's efforts are recognized by Scrooge, who expresses gratitude towards him for the opportunity to alter his life path. This comprehensive portrayal highlights Marley's integral connection to Scrooge's journey towards redemption.\",2\n20,\"\"\"MARLEY\"\"\",\"Marley, who is consistently referenced as a deceased individual, was Scrooge's former business partner and has been dead for seven years. His presence and past actions have a significant and lingering effect on Scrooge, indicating a deep connection between the two. This connection is further emphasized by Marley's appearance as a supernatural phenomenon on Scrooge's door knocker, symbolizing his ongoing presence in Scrooge's life. The fact that Marley, now a ghost, was Scrooge's business partner establishes the premise for the ghostly events that follow in the narrative, highlighting the intertwined fates of Marley and Scrooge.\",2\n122,\"\"\"PHANTOM\"\"\",\"The Phantom is a spectral figure that plays a crucial role in guiding Scrooge on his transformative journey. This entity serves as both a silent observer and a catalyst for Scrooge's reflections, showing him a series of scenes that are highly relevant to his life and moral development. Through these scenes, The Phantom imparts lessons of morality and consequence, effectively serving as a bridge between Scrooge's past, present, and potential future. The Phantom's guidance is instrumental in Scrooge's realization and understanding of the impact of his actions, leading him towards a path of redemption.\",2\n124,\"\"\"RED-FACED GENTLEMAN\"\"\",\"\"\"A red-faced gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on his nose, interested in the deceased's money and the funeral arrangements.\"\"\",2\n21,\"\"\"SCROOGE AND MARLEY\"\"\",\"\"\"Scrooge and Marley is the name of the business firm, indicating its significance in the story and its association with both Scrooge and Marley.\"\"\",2\n23,\"\"\"SCROOGE'S NEPHEW\"\"\",\"Scrooge's nephew, Fred, is the embodiment of the Christmas spirit, contrasting sharply with his uncle Scrooge's skepticism and isolation. Fred is characterized by his cheerful, optimistic nature, and his persistent efforts to share the joy and merriment of the holiday season with Scrooge. He is depicted as a jovial and optimistic character, who not only encourages merriment but also expresses pity for his uncle's bitterness and isolation, especially during Christmas. Fred's involvement in a game of Yes and No, which leads to a revelation that the answer is his uncle Scrooge, further highlights his persistent attempts to connect with and understand his uncle. Through his actions and outlook, Fred serves as a stark contrast to Scrooge, embodying the spirit of Christmas and the potential for change and goodwill towards others.\",2\n25,\"\"\"THE CITY\"\"\",\"The City, as depicted in the narrative, refers to the unspecified urban setting, likely London, where characters such as Scrooge, Bob Cratchit, and Tiny Tim reside. It symbolizes the broader societal context of the story, encapsulating the cold, bleak, and foggy environment that sets a somber tone for the narrative. This setting is crucial as it not only houses Scrooge's counting-house but also vanishes as Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Past travel back in time to his childhood. The City, therefore, serves as a backdrop that reflects the harsh realities of the time and underscores the personal transformation journey of Scrooge.\",2\n33,\"\"\"THE POOR LAW\"\"\",\"\"\"The Poor Law is mentioned as being in full vigour, indicating its role in the societal and legal framework concerning the poor.\"\"\",2\n34,\"\"\"THE TREADMILL\"\"\",\"\"\"The Treadmill is referenced alongside the Poor Law, symbolizing the harsh conditions and attitudes towards the impoverished during this era.\"\"\",2\n133,\"\"\"THE TOWN\"\"\",,2\n55,\"\"\"ALI BABA\"\"\",\"\"\"Ali Baba is mentioned by Scrooge as a character from his reading during a solitary Christmas, symbolizing his childhood imagination and loneliness.\"\"\",1\n75,\"\"\"BELLE\"\"\",\"\"\"Belle is mentioned as the wife of a man who encounters Scrooge, representing a connection to Scrooge's past.\"\"\",1\n125,\"\"\"CHANGE\"\"\",\"\"\"'Change refers to the Royal Exchange in London, a central location for merchants and businessmen where Scrooge and the Phantom observe a conversation.\"\"\",1\n123,\"\"\"CITY\"\"\",\"\"\"The City is where Scrooge and the Phantom find themselves among merchants and business men, indicating its bustling economic activity.\"\"\",1\n26,\"\"\"COUNTING-HOUSE\"\"\",,1\n135,\"\"\"DEATH\"\"\",\"\"\"Death is personified in the text as a pivotal event that catalyzes change and reflection in Scrooge's character.\"\"\",1\n54,\"\"\"EXTINGUISHER\"\"\",,1\n60,\"\"\"FRIDAY\"\"\",\"\"\"Friday is mentioned by Scrooge in the context of running for his life, a character from the stories that Scrooge fondly remembers from his past.\"\"\",1\n73,\"\"\"GAIN\"\"\",\"\"\"Gain is depicted as the master passion, engrossing a character, indicating a shift in priorities from nobler aspirations.\"\"\",1\n62,\"\"\"GHOST\"\"\",\"The Ghost plays a pivotal role in Charles Dickens' classic tale, engaging with the character Scrooge on a transformative journey. This spectral guide takes Scrooge through a series of past Christmases, revealing scenes from his earlier life to instill in him the true spirit of Christmas. Additionally, The Ghost confronts Scrooge with the potential fate of Tiny Tim, challenging and expanding Scrooge's worldview. Through these interactions, The Ghost serves as a crucial catalyst for Scrooge's eventual change of heart, embodying the essence of Christmas spirit and the possibility of redemption.\",1\n120,\"\"\"IGNORANCE\"\"\",\"\"\"Ignorance is personified as a boy shown to Scrooge by the Spirit, representing a societal problem that leads to doom unless addressed.\"\"\",1\n47,\"\"\"JACOB\"\"\",\"Jacob is mentioned as Scrooge's old partner in the narrative, highlighting his past significance to Scrooge.

Initially characterized by his miserliness, isolation, and a practical, skeptical approach to life, Scrooge's attitude towards Christmas, relationships, and humanity at large undergoes a profound transformation following a series of supernatural visitations. These visitations are from various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and other spectral figures, who guide him through a journey of self-reflection and moral awakening.\n\nThroughout this journey, Scrooge is confronted with different aspects of his life, humanity, and the consequences of his actions.

Initially characterized by his miserliness, isolation, and a practical, skeptical approach to life, Scrooge's attitude towards Christmas, relationships, and humanity at large undergoes a profound transformation following a series of supernatural visitations. These visitations are from various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and other spectral figures, who guide him through a journey of self-reflection and moral awakening.\n\nThroughout this journey, Scrooge is confronted with different aspects of his life, humanity, and the consequences of his actions. He reflects on his past Christmas experiences with both joy and sorrow, particularly during interactions with the Ghost and his own younger self. He witnesses scenes of Christmas cheer, the aftermath of a man's death, and the impact of his own choices on others, including his clerk Bob Cratchit and Cratchit's family. This leads to a moment of realization and a plea for change, as Scrooge fears the world's reproach and sees his nobler aspirations fall off for the pursuit of gain.\n\nDespite his initial reluctance and fear, Scrooge shows curiosity, skepticism, and eventually, a willingness to learn and change. He undergoes a significant transformation, expressing regret for his past actions and a strong desire to change his future. This change is marked by deep emotional responses to the visions shown by the spirits and a newfound understanding of the importance of compassion, generosity, and the Christmas spirit.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Scrooge's transformation becomes evident through his actions. He decides to buy a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engages positively with people on the streets, showing a change in mood and behavior. His transformation is central to the narrative, indirectly affecting the lives of those around him, including the Cratchit family and his nephew.\n\nScrooge's journey from a stingy, hard, and unfeeling man to a better friend, master, and man known for keeping Christmas well illustrates the potential for change and redemption. His experiences with the spirits and the profound moment of realization and reflection lead to a significant transformation, making him a symbol of the power of Christmas and human kindness to evoke change and foster a more compassionate and connected society.\",74\n11,\"\"\"GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST\"\"\",\"The Ghost of Christmas Past is a spectral figure that visits Scrooge to show him scenes from his past.

Marley's efforts are recognized by Scrooge, who expresses gratitude towards him for the opportunity to alter his life path. This comprehensive portrayal highlights Marley's integral connection to Scrooge's journey towards redemption.\",2\n20,\"\"\"MARLEY\"\"\",\"Marley, who is consistently referenced as a deceased individual, was Scrooge's former business partner and has been dead for seven years. His presence and past actions have a significant and lingering effect on Scrooge, indicating a deep connection between the two. This connection is further emphasized by Marley's appearance as a supernatural phenomenon on Scrooge's door knocker, symbolizing his ongoing presence in Scrooge's life.

Initially characterized by his miserliness, isolation, and a practical, skeptical approach to life, Scrooge's attitude towards Christmas, relationships, and humanity at large undergoes a profound transformation following a series of supernatural visitations. These visitations are from various spirits, including the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and other spectral figures, who guide him through a journey of self-reflection and moral awakening.\n\nThroughout this journey, Scrooge is confronted with different aspects of his life, humanity, and the consequences of his actions. He reflects on his past Christmas experiences with both joy and sorrow, particularly during interactions with the Ghost and his own younger self. He witnesses scenes of Christmas cheer, the aftermath of a man's death, and the impact of his own choices on others, including his clerk Bob Cratchit and Cratchit's family. This leads to a moment of realization and a plea for change, as Scrooge fears the world's reproach and sees his nobler aspirations fall off for the pursuit of gain.\n\nDespite his initial reluctance and fear, Scrooge shows curiosity, skepticism, and eventually, a willingness to learn and change. He undergoes a significant transformation, expressing regret for his past actions and a strong desire to change his future. This change is marked by deep emotional responses to the visions shown by the spirits and a newfound understanding of the importance of compassion, generosity, and the Christmas spirit.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Scrooge's transformation becomes evident through his actions. He decides to buy a large turkey for Bob Cratchit and engages positively with people on the streets, showing a change in mood and behavior. His transformation is central to the narrative, indirectly affecting the lives of those around him, including the Cratchit family and his nephew.\n\nScrooge's journey from a stingy, hard, and unfeeling man to a better friend, master, and man known for keeping Christmas well illustrates the potential for change and redemption.
